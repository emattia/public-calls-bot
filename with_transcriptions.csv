 >> And okay.
 >> I knew you couldn't do it.
 >> This year is my 58th consecutive year as an elected official.
 >> I never planned on doing it for more than just a few years.
 Now we're going on 28 years.
 >> I knew it was time to leave about three weeks after I got to Congress.
 It just took me a long time to try to figure out how to get out of this place.
 [MUSIC]
 >> I think one of the most frustrating things was to me the best part of this job.
 >> So that's a big question everyone wants to know the answer to is how do you quote fix Congress?
 [MUSIC]
 >> One word I'd use to describe Congress.
 I would say- >> Dysfunctional.
 >> Chaotic.
 >> Chaotic, it's just very challenging.
 >> Difficult.
 Last year when the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they passed 27 bills.
 Which made us the most unproductive Congress in any given year in the United States history.
 >> Dysfunctional.
 >> Tense?
 >> Dysfunctional.
 Probably a very popular word that you're hearing.
 >> Misunderstood.
 The misunderstanding is that people are purposefully trying to not accomplish goals on behalf of the American people.
 >> That's just not true.
 >> Potential.
 >> The institution right now is punching below its weight.
 >> Challenging.
 >> Broken.
 >> No, I don't see the corruption.
 >> Congress is absolutely not corrupt.
 >> Both Democrats and Republicans, by and large, they're just trying to do what we believe we need to do for our districts and for our constituents.
 >> I think that there are parts of our system that are corrupting to the general atmosphere.
 >> There is undue influence for special interests, absolutely.
 >> Some people do tend to favor large business and special interests.
 >> The corporations and special interests.
 >> Tsunami of money that comes in from special interest groups.
 >> And that is a form of corruption.
 There's no question.
 >> I think there's too much money in our political system.
 >> I was told at the beginning that I had to raise $250,000 if I wanted to be on certain committees.
 And if I wanted to be on more important committees or committees with broader jurisdiction, I needed to raise even more money.
 >> Buying a committee seat is not something that most Americans know that members of Congress have to do.
 >> The number of times over the course of the 11-plus years that I've heard one of my colleagues say,
 you know, I agree with you on that, but I could never vote that way because of my fear of a primary is concerning.
 >> Citizens United was a horrible decision by the Supreme Court that held corporations had the rights as individuals to make contributions in our campaign.
 It led to the floodgates of a lot of special interest dollars coming into campaigns without really knowing who was contributing those dollars.
 >> I have been a big supporter of campaign finance reform.
 >> We need campaign finance reform.
 >> Change the way campaigns are funded in America.
 >> And definitely by demanding disclosure of this dark money.
 >> Oh, you know, I'd have to go through a laundry list of a few hundreds.
 >> There are frustrations every day.
 >> We were at a budget standoff over the debt ceiling, and Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Biden negotiated a budget agreement.
 Then Speaker McCarthy walked away from that agreement.
 I've had lots of disagreements with people, but the thing that's most frustrating now is that the environment seems to give permission for people to come to an understanding, to shake hands,
 and then erase all memory of that deal when it becomes convenient to do so.
 >> What frustrates me is that members tend to say something, make a statement,
 make a speech that maybe could go viral or get picked up.
 Instead of thinking, well, what's the best conversation I can have here?
 >> One of the most frustrating experiences for me was the antitrust legislation concerning big tech.
 They have so much money and so much influence on the hill that we just can't move forward on those issues.
 >> I think the most frustrating thing is when you have 300 co-sponsors to a bill and you still can't get that across the finish line.
 >> I think one of the most frustrating things was when the Republicans were not able to choose a speaker.
 >> Then the frustration of being in the house and being told all the time, this is how you need to vote.
 >> The part of me that wanted to stick around because I believed we could get more things done died.
 >> To me, the best part of this job is the fact of who you get to be with every day.
 >> You get to go on some congressional trips when you're sitting across from the prime minister of Japan.
 That's pretty cool.
 >> We get to see demonstrations of technology at laboratories.
 >> You're talking to experts who are shaping the future and you get to talk to four or five of them in a single day.
 >> The House Jim. >> The House Jim. The House Jim is great.
 >> I wish I took more advantage of that.
 >> Now, it's only about a C plus YMCA, but it is 100 feet away from your office.
 >> The first time I went to the White House and met the President of the United States, I was really over the moon.
 >> Well, it's pretty cool to go to the White House Christmas party and meet the President, you know.
 I've got pictures now with three presidents, President Obama, President Trump, and just recently President Biden.
 >> I think there are a lot of perks that I am really irritated by and I've shown.
 >> I don't want people calling me congressman. I don't want people holding the door for me.
 >> The most amazing part about my job as a United States congressman is every time I'm driving up to the Capitol and I see that beautiful iconic dome.
 >> Capitol gleaming in the sun, it is like to die for.
 >> And every day I sort of pinch myself and say, I'm here, I'm doing this.
 >> I love the history of the Capitol building and I like giving tours.
 There's a Ronald Reagan statue in one layer of that statue is pieces of the Berlin Wall.
 And so I have people rub their finger around that.
 >> The coolest thing about this job is that I have the same job as John Lewis.
 And when John was dying, he picked me, little Dan Kildeed from West Genesee Street in Flint, Michigan,
 to cast his vote for him. That's not a perk. That's a privilege.
 And if we're just for the fact that I'll go for the rest of my life having become a friend of and a partner to John Lewis,
 it will have been worth all the stuff that we have to deal with here.
 Didn't want to use a more colorful word in that context, but I could have.
 >> Most definitely.
 >> For sure.
 >> I really feel like I was able to make a difference.
 >> 66 bills.
 >> Hundreds of amendments.
 >> A couple hundred million dollars from the water crisis in Flint.
 >> Dealing with transportation, land use.
 >> On national defense.
 >> On health care issues.
 >> I was the first woman to chair the Health Subcommittee.
 >> Solve the surprise medical billing problem.
 >> Expanding rural broadband.
 >> Permit the Smithsonian to build a Latino museum.
 >> Help write a bipartisan infrastructure bill that has the biggest investment ever.
 >> And climate provisions.
 >> Managed to bring mental health into the light.
 >> I was responsible for passage of cancer screening coverage under Medicare.
 >> Some of the bills that I carried, I carried for eight and ten years before they came to fruition.
 >> These are things that have had a profound effect.
 >> It really appears to the public that all we do is fight when the reality has done 98% of the issues.
 There's great bipartisanship and people work together well and come up with good answers.
 >> So I really reject the notion that you can't get things done.
 >> They didn't take this job for the pay.
 >> You know, I don't think we pay our congressmen enough.
 Look, the average income in my district is $55,000 a year.
 A congressman makes $174,000 a year.
 >> If I go back to my district where the average salary in some places is $32,000
 and I say I don't make enough when I make $174,000, they would go ballistic.
 I'd be out of office in a heartbeat.
 And yet, I'm trying to maintain two places to live, have clothes in two places, have a car in two places.
 It's very difficult.
 >> When I got to congress, I realized holy smokes, that comes out of my pocket without reimbursement.
 >> And do not allow to write off any of the expenses.
 >> Had a roommate every time I brought in a department.
 >> Upwards of 100 congress members actually sleep in their office, because it's expensive.
 >> Washington is expensive.
 >> All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this.
 >> Do you want it to still be the house of the people?
 Or do you want it to be only wealthy people?
 >> I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments.
 >> I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment.
 I think it should at least keep up with inflation.
 It should probably go up with the cost of living.
 >> Congress works better when you have a broad swath of the American people
 being able to run and get elected.
 I really believe that.
 >> I worry about the future of our democracy.
 >> Are we going to protect our democracy?
 >> The state of our democracy.
 >> You know, I saw it pretty up close and personally on the 6th of January, how fragile it is.
 >> A lot of the concerns I have now are about the geopolitical climate around the world.
 >> Those autocratic regimes around the world.
 >> What worries me most is I'm not giving my grandkids the same country that my parents gave me.
 Social security will be bankrupt within a few years, Medicare the same way.
 We can't sustain $34 trillion of debt.
 Right now, the incentive is to spend all the money that we don't have and put the burden on our
 grandchildren because I get to go back to my district and tell people my district,
 I got that bridge for you.
 We improve this interstate highway.
 We have no spending discipline.
 >> Very simple solution.
 You need to change the incentive structure.
 For example, members of Congress don't get a salary unless they balance the budget or
 they don't get to run for re-election unless they have reduced the amount of spending.
 Responsible government is the best way to move forward.
 >> So that's a big question everyone wants to know the answer to is how do you
 quote fix Congress?
 >> What's the American people that have to fix the Congress?
 >> Well, I think the American people are going to have to fix it.
 >> You'd have to change culture.
 You have to fix it at the root.
 >> In the 1970s, 80s, members of Congress stayed in D.C.
 >> People would bring their families to the city of Washington and they would live there.
 Their kids would go to school.
 >> And their families got to know each other and they got to know each other on a social basis.
 >> Folks didn't jump on an airplane on a Thursday afternoon and head for home.
 >> So there was less divisiveness.
 There was less hate.
 Now, getting back to the district is essential.
 So I can see why it's shifted, but the shift has caused some of the dysfunction in Congress.
 I think what we have to do is, and I actually work with Derek Kilmer, who is also leaving.
 One of my very close friends, who's also leaving Congress, Derek Kilmer, came up with some really
 thoughtful structural system changes.
 >> When I became a member of Congress, I was conscious of the fact that I was joining an
 organization that, according to recent polling, is less popular than headlice,
 colonoscopies, and the rock band Nickelback.
 And so a lot of the time that I've spent here has been trying to figure out what do you do?
 And Speaker Pelosi asked me to chair a committee called the Select Committee on the Modernization
 of Congress, which makes us sound like we were the IT Helpdesk.
 But we were nicknamed the Fix Congress Committee.
 And it was a group of six Democrats and six Republicans, and it went over four years.
 And we looked under the hood of the institution and tried to propose reforms to make Congress
 work better for the American people.
 Everything from looking at how Congress can do a better job of recruiting and retaining
 and having more diverse staff, how Congress uses technology, even looking at some tricky issues,
 like how do you have a more civil and collaborative institution?
 And we had one hearing where we invited in a political scientist, management consultant,
 organizational psychologist, marriage counselor.
 I thought about bringing in an exorcist.
 I sat up time with this football coach who took over a team that had a notoriously corrosive
 culture, and he turned it into a winner.
 And I said, ""Coach, what do you do when you have players on the team that are trying to sabotage
 the team?"" And he said, ""Why, cut them."" And I said, ""Well, we don't really have that option.""
 And then he asked me a question. He said, ""How do you do new player orientation?""
 Much of the orientation process is an exercise in keeping the two parties from
 talking to each other.
 Okay, Democrats, you get on this bus, Republicans, you get on that bus.
 And this coach said to me, ""Well, I don't know much about Congress, but it seems like
 you ought to stop doing that.""
 And this last year, the orientation process actually involved Democrats and Republicans
 going through orientation together.
 Listen, someone could look at that and say, ""Hey, bang up job, Kilmer. You know, Congress
 is clearly fixed."" Obviously, that's not the case, although I'm reminded of a conversation
 I had with the House Chaplain during like the 15th round of votes for Speaker of the House.
 And I said, ""Pray harder."" She put her hand on my elbow, and she said,
 ""Just imagine how rough things will be if I wasn't praying this hard.""
 So that's sort of how I look at the Work of the Modernization Committee.
 We've passed 202 recommendations, and I actually think over time,
 you're going to see some positive change within the institution as a consequence of that work.
 I think that's it for us, but thank you so much. This has been really great.
 Do you bet?
 Yeah.
 Did I forget anything?
 What's your idea?
 Do you think I'm a tough ender of you?
 All right.
 Your honorary members of the congressional vice president.
 Yeah, thank you. Oh, thank you all.
 There's no individual call.
 Sir, there you have it.
 Okay, good."

 Is there room for free will and a law like universe?
 We humans and other agents that claim to have real are governed by
 causal processes that you can therefore look at the antecedents of any
 decision that I make, can I still be said to be acting freely?
 I tend to think of it as we have a partial view of reality, of the
 quantum reality in this case, and that gives us the impression of a collapse.
 Today, we have a treat with panelist George Musser, who is a writer for
 Scientific American, also Quantum Magazine and new scientist.
 He's also the author of A Complete Idiot's Guide to String Theory.
 And he has a new book on consciousness called putting ourselves back in the
 equation why physicists are studying human consciousness and AI to unravel
 the mysteries of the universe.
 Links to everything said will be in the description, including this book,
 which I recommend you check out.
 This panel is conducted by Professor of Philosophy, Susan Schneider, from the
 Florida Atlantic University.
 The introductions are given by yours truly.
 This talk was given at Mindfest, put on by the Center for the Future Mind,
 which is spearheaded by Professor of Philosophy, Susan Schneider.
 It's a conference that's annually held where they merge artificial
 intelligence and consciousness studies and help at Florida Atlantic University.
 The links to all of these will be in the description.
 There's also a playlist here for Mindfest.
 Again, that's that conference merge in AI and consciousness.
 There are previous talks from people like Scott Aronson, David Chalmers,
 Stuart Hammeroff, Sarah Walker, Stephen Wolfram and Ben Gortzel.
 My name is Kurt Jaemungel and today we have a special treat because usually
 theories of everything is a podcast.
 What's ordinarily done on this channel is I use my background in mathematical
 physics and I analyze various theories of everything from that perspective and
 analytical one, but as well as a philosophical one discerning, well, what's
 consciousness's relationship to fundamental reality?
 What is reality?
 Are the laws as they exist, even the laws and should they be mathematical?
 But instead, I was invited down to film these talks and bring them to you,
 courtesy of the Center for the Future Mind.
 Enjoy this talk from Mindfest.
 So my name is Kurt Jaemungel.
 For those of you who don't know me, I have a channel on YouTube called
 theories of everything where we investigate what is the fundamental law,
 much like Sarah Walker was talking about earlier or what are the fundamental
 laws, usually from a physics perspective, for the past few years, we've gotten
 more into what is consciousness and does that have any constitutive role to play?
 Today, we're here for a book salon with George Muser to cover this book called
 putting ourselves in the equation.
 This is a fantastic book, by the way.
 George Muser is an award-winning journalist, a contributing editor at
 Scientific American and Quantum Magazine and recently new scientist as well.
 He's the author of Spooky Action at a Distance.
 The link is in the description.
 It's also on screen now if you're watching this at home.
 Here's some reviews of George's book.
 This one's from Carlo Raveli putting ourselves back in the equation is a delightful
 account of one of the deepest and most fascinating explorations going on today
 at the frontier of our knowledge.
 I couldn't put this book down.
 It reveals the science of what makes reality tick and what makes us all conscious,
 all explored with lively inviting prose that draws the reader in from cover to
 cover. Now, that last quote is from Dr.
 Susan Schneider.
 Dr. Susan Schneider is a found is the founding director for the center for the
 future mind, Florida Atlantic University.
 Distinguished professor of philosophy of mind, Susan writes about the nature of
 the self and mind, especially from the vantage point of issues in philosophy,
 AI, cognitive science and astrobiology.
 Take it away, Susan.
 Oh, thank you.
 Is it on?
 Kurt, thank you so much for joining us again this year and our partnership with
 theories of everything has been just really wonderful and we appreciate the
 introduction and George, I meant every word I said when I, you know, I mean,
 you know how much I love your work because I've been reading you for years
 and now we've been talking for, I mean, I call you a lot, actually, when I'm
 confused about things in quantum mechanics.
 There are times when it probably drives you crazy and you're so sweet.
 Oh, you, you never drive me completely crazy.
 So it's fine.
 But I've always been inspired by your work.
 And Kurt, let's give a shout out to your YouTube channel.
 Dives, it's hard to go. It's no place else really on YouTube, certainly, that has
 the kind of deep dives that you do hours, literally hours of, of discussions
 about fun foundational questions in science.
 For sure.
 And so you've done it again.
 You've written a crystal clear articulation of some of the most difficult
 issues.
 And so what I'd like to start with is I'd like to ask you, I want to just dive
 right into the material.
 If you don't mind, tell me about the two key problems you begin your book with.
 It's a kind of set up shop for the audience.
 You say there are twin hard problems.
 Yeah, this is really, I should also give a shout out to Dave Chalmers, who
 inspired me and continues to inspire me.
 So the twin hard problems and Sarah introduced a third today, but I only
 really deal with two of them, are the hard problems of mind and of matter.
 So the question of how the material world gives rise to consciousness,
 those two sides seem incommensurate with each other.
 And also there's this hard problem of matter, which doesn't get as much
 attention, but Dave has it tucked into a chapter of his book in 1996, that we
 don't really even have a deep understanding of the physical material world.
 And it's intrinsic nature of indeed, if it had, if it has one.
 So I just framed the beginning of the book as calling it the twin hard
 problems, because I think often the hard problems associated with the
 questions of consciousness.
 And that of course, that's perhaps the bigger of the of the two.
 But there's also this question of understanding matter.
 And that's squarely in the wheelhouse of the physicist.
 And my interest in this book is to try to come at these intersectional
 questions from the perspective of physics.
 I don't claim to how about a comprehensive look at consciousness, at
 AI, at any of these issues.
 But I'm carving out that little part of it that physics seems to interface
 with.
 Excellent.
 And that leads me to ask you, I mean, I find, oh, today's earlier talk was so
 amazing by Stuart Hameroff.
 And of course, you and I have been very interested in Stuart's work and, you
 know, Hartman's going to be giving a presentation as well on some of these
 issues today, or maybe it's tomorrow, everything's become okay.
 Everything's a blur since I'm the conference organizer.
 And I just wanted to start with a very general question for the audience.
 Well, first of all, I want to emphasize by consciousness in this discussion, we
 have in mind that felt quality of experience.
 So whenever you, you know, smell a cup of coffee, or you see the
 rituals of a sunset, it always feels like something from the inside to be you.
 And I know consciousness, that expression can be used in lots of ways.
 But when we're talking about consciousness, that's what we're talking
 about here.
 And we're trying to figure out what could the physical basis of consciousness be.
 And of course, if we could figure that out, we could figure out all the real
 exciting questions, like whether AI is conscious, whether the mind could be
 extended in some way.
 I mean, all kinds of intriguing questions and even the age old question
 of whether consciousness can outrun the brain, right?
 So I want to start with your interest in quantum mechanics here in
 relations to the phenomenon of consciousness and just ask you a very
 general question, in what ways might consciousness depend on quantum mechanics?
 Yeah, so this is obviously a huge question.
 It was really central to Stuart's comments.
 And before I go there, let me just back up and give you a sense of my own kind
 of intellectual approach to things.
 I'm the Schmorgesborg person here.
 I'm the person who goes to the buffet and orders everything in the buffet and
 bring it back to my, and my plate is filled with a little bit of each of those
 dishes, and so I am with intellectual matters, including the integration
 of quantum mechanics, including the understanding of consciousness.
 I don't have any strong scholarly commitments to a different area.
 I kind of go at a higher, maybe more superficial, but somewhat higher
 perspective on the different issues.
 So I'm fascinated by the apparent connections between quantum physics and
 our minds, because there does seem to be, and I use the word seem here, it seems
 in the sense of when we make a measurement of the world, that we seem
 to affect the system that we're measuring, and in a particular way, we
 collapse the wave function or reduce it.
 Now, the seem may be an illusion, of course, it may, there may actually be no
 effect or the effect may be more about us than about the system.
 But nonetheless, and Stuart had a nice little yin yang slide where the
 whole consciousness snakes down, and that's the kind of interface that
 fascinates me, and there's different ways to understand why does our observation
 something seem to affect it?
 Does it in fact affect it, or is there some, or how would the illusion
 of that effect be constructed?
 So the most direct kind of explanation would be is we do indeed cause
 the collapse of the wave function.
 There's this haze of possibility upon measuring that system, that quantum
 system, we cause it to select one of those options.
 And sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 Do you mean that consciousness does that?
 Or do you mean any kind of measurement, not necessarily by a conscious observer?
 Yeah.
 So I think it's crucial here that, and this is something that really goes
 back to von Neumann's first analysis, that really the consciousness seems
 to be important, because if there's a purely mechanical registration, for
 instance, if there's a chain called the von Neumann chain, a measurement, if
 you measure a photon, and you do it using, or maybe electron, let's say,
 and you do it using a magnet, and there's particle detectors, and there's a
 computer, and there's a whole line of instrumentation that leads
 to your own awareness, or own perception of the measured quantity.
 There's this long chain, and each of step of the chain is normally described
 using the wave mechanics in that particular picture of quantum mechanics.
 And there's never any collapse that occurs.
 If it's, the collapse only seems to happen in our own awareness.
 And again, I used to emphasize the word seems here.
 There may actually be a collapse earlier in the chain, but that's not
 described by our current theories of quantum mechanics.
 The third theory quantum mechanics says all the way up to our conscious
 registration, there is a multiplicity of options, the so-called superposition.
 Like Schrodinger's cat is alive and dead kind of, of thing.
 So one option of many is that there is indeed an effect that the mind has
 mysterious, by the way, but an effect the mind has on the object.
 Others would be that there's an external, and this is kind of more of Roger
 Penrose's idea.
 There's an external physical process occurring gravitational in his case,
 but there are other options that causes this collapse.
 Another option which I explore in a whole chapter is, in fact, there is no collapse.
 Collapse is kind of an artifact of our imperfect observation of the quantum world.
 And that's kind of analogous to the Copernican revolution in which we don't
 perceive the motion of the earth around the sun directly because we're stuck on the earth.
 And we think we're the center of the universe, but in fact, we're not.
 Likewise, there's a Copernican sense in which the observation of the wave function may depend on.
 It seems to us that we cause the collapse, but in fact there may be other branches
 the wave function and they may persist.
 And the collapse is a product of our interior view.
 And that's what takes you down the whole path of the many worlds interpretation.
 I prefer to think of it as people often talk about the branching of the universe and the
 building universes or whatever out there.
 I tend to think of it as we have a partial view of reality,
 of the quantum reality in this case, and that gives us the impression of a collapse.
 Okay, those details aside, the point being is there's many ways to read this apparent
 effect of the mind or on quantum systems.
 Wow, I don't even know what to ask because there's so much richness there.
 There is really.
 There really is.
 So now what would the name of your particular theory be?
 Just so audience members can Google it and kind of learn more about the approach that
 you just alluded to.
 And then I want to also go to the Penrose approach and the related approach that we heard this
 morning, which is often tied to pen roses, but we'll go in a minute.
 Let's first get the name out there.
 So I'll answer that in two pieces.
 First, remember I'm the Smorgasbord person here.
 I'm not committed to any of those views.
 They all I think can and should be entertained.
 By the way, I'm really inspired by Dave Chalmers' work on this.
 I mean, in your work, in your papers, your book, you lay out a number of options and
 yeah, you have your own preferences, but you lay them all out.
 And I think that's important in a subject that's under development to leave all options open.
 So I leave all options open.
 Yeah, you sounded most excited by the first one.
 So maybe not.
 No, I honestly do think options are open.
 If anything excites me, it's more the kind of many worlds view or the idea that we have
 a partial glimpse of reality in some way or other.
 And there's other stuff out there that we don't have a direct kind of purchase on.
 But that course raises its own questions and all these things raise questions.
 Questions are being raised.
 It's a beautiful picture of reality of you in which there are many possibilities,
 all of which are equally real in a way, right?
 And you would have a multiverse and I mean, that's amazing.
 And of course, it's a well respected view, especially in astrophysics and in many parts of physics.
 And I also though want to turn to Stuart Hemorov's position this morning.
 And I wanted to ask you because this is something we were just talking about.
 In fact, I put a few media articles on this topic that we've been involved in in the back
 of the room there in case any audience members want to read them.
 But one thing that came up with Stuart's intriguing position is that consciousness
 is instantiated by the brain and furthermore, we're getting some sort of a glimpse of that picture
 through the experimentation involving microtubules.
 And I guess the thing that perplexed me about that position was I'm also a big fan of Roger Penrose
 and his approach is very controversial though within the quantum gravity field.
 It's as interesting as it is. Do you see these views as coming apart or do you see them as being
 essentially combined? Yeah, I think this is a really important point. I think Hartman may get
 into this in his talk as well that what Stuart, where are you? Okay, this is my reading of your
 approach and we can discuss your disagreements with that offline. But I think the Penrose
 hammer-off view needs to be thought of as a series of independent proposals each of which can be
 independently tested and can stand or fall. So one of those is one of those pillars you could say is
 that there is an objective collapse of the wave function and actually second that that
 collapse of the wave function is due to gravitational effects essentially or due to a conflict with
 classical gravity. And then built on top of that is a third, fourth, etc. pillar that the quantum
 effects occur in microtubules that they're implicated in consciousness and so forth. There's a series
 of proposals here that are in fact being independently tested. And I think some may be right and some
 may be wrong. And that's how science works. This is again, much Morgersborg approach. I think
 that theories that are maybe wrong in their totality or elements of the moron can nonetheless push
 science forward. So I think this view has had an incredibly productive effect on asking questions
 such as, ""Is there an objective collapse of the wave function?"" And there are measurements made,
 I guess in Grand Sasso, CERN maybe have made measurements are wave functions collapsing
 and are they collapsing due to gravitational effects? Extremely important because it's one
 of the great top questions in science. And our microtubules, is the neuron doctrine wrong? Is the
 relevant level description in the brain not that of neurons and maybe glia at that cellular level
 but is it intracellular? There is a series of empirical questions that I think are important
 to address because it is taken as a given in neuroscience that you start with the neuron and
 okay maybe the neuron is complicated but you can kind of reduce that to a function and then
 go up from that and build your neural network. And maybe actually Stuart and Roger suggest we
 need to look inside the neuron. And maybe quantum effects are involved now. So this is a series of
 independent ideas here all of which are productive I think. This is my view of his of their theory.
 And I think Stuart got into it a little bit as talk history needs to be viewed as panpsychists
 ultimately. And a very interesting version of panpsychism too that there are experiences just
 they're occurring around us every time in this view that a wave function collapses they're just
 out there not associated necessarily from a material object but our brains kind of corral them.
 They I think the metaphor using the book is they're a garden and the the brain acts as a gardener
 creating the conditions under which these experiences can arise and then stitches them together and
 creates a self an narrative self etc. So I think it's a fascinating idea it could be wrong
 but I think it's worth exploring that's my view. At TLC Laser Eye Centers we know LASIC is a big

 It is fascinating on so many levels and I think that was very helpful and I suppose
 many people when they read your book and then when they think of these issues
 move to questions of free will, right? I mean so suppose that the relevant level of explanation
 for human behavior isn't the neural level or even the system level I'm more of a systems person
 myself right but it really does it it resides at the level of the quantum. How does that change
 one's view of agency and free will so is there a sense in which humans act freely? What would
 that sense be according to these views? I know that these issues are very vexing and people often
 confuse the very idea of free will, right? Right so I'm you know I hesitate to tread into the
 waters of free will surrounded by world's eminent philosophers but I'll give you my kind of student
 undergraduate level view of all this which is that the is there room for free will in a law like
 universe? So if there are we humans and other agents that claim to have real are governed by
 causal processes that you can therefore look at the antecedents of any decision that I make
 can I still be said to be acting freely? And I and this is the one place I would make a
 scholarly commitment and wouldn't be the buffet eating person I tend to be a compatibalist I think
 there is and should be and must be just experientially my experience is that I have free will that's
 my datum here is I have free will and I as an empiricist I try to explain my data how would
 explain that based on the fact that I am governed by the laws of physics I don't stand outside physics
 so I need to reconcile my at least my kind of feeling of free will with the the law like
 evolution of the universe so I've fallen into that compatibalist camp and one one way I think about it
 is free will kind of means that my decisions would say to take that come from me so it's like you
 imagine could draw an arrow you two decisions in a way to me that's that's okay simplifying but
 that's kind of what free will would be for me but do you could have an arrow pointing into it and
 that wouldn't affect the fact that I'm still the author of my own choices I'm perfectly going to
 accept if I wind back to the Big Bang or just even the second ago and the light cone everything
 with my light cone affects what I do but that doesn't render me unfree and one might argue I
 just have the illusion of free will but then I would say maybe the illusion and the actuality
 free will kind of collapse down into the same thing now I'm looking forward to the philosophers
 sitting me straight on this but this is my kind of you know junior college level because that's the
 last time I took a metaphysics class view on compatibalism that was really nice and as usual
 you know you always say that oh you don't know anything about something and then you
 say it so well and let me just play devil's advocate though and you know I think there is so many
 different ways that the quantum world could impact cognition or consciousness and it might be
 interesting to pull apart different situations and one situation that worries me when it comes to
 compatible is free will or even the more radical form of free will which is called libertarianism
 not related to the uh political yeah small ill uh is a situation in which
 the brain is sensitive to quantum phenomena and quantum phenomena you know it's inherently
 chancy so I'm not talking about any kind of hidden variables it's just chance and somehow it
 actually causally impacts a decision you make and being that it is chance in a way that wouldn't
 really be even a compatible essence in which we're free because we're prisoners of
 absolute randomness so I'm just curious if indeed quantum mechanics does impact cognition
 how you really achieve even the compatible essence of free will in that kind of a scenario
 I'm not speaking to all scenarios but so this would be the subset of the question of how do I
 reconcile free will with an indeterministic physics and I guess I have two thoughts on that again
 the philosophers please help me on this uh that there would be some fraction of our cognition that
 could be attributed to these indeterministic processes and some that couldn't and those that
 couldn't know in other words those that would trace my decision choice deliberation further back
 before that indeterministic event the free will would resign there reside there and then the
 indeterministic event would be like some kind of constraint on my choice like my arm being held
 behind my back something equivalent to that um or the conditions of my birth or something that
 led to um something outside my control another way actually riffing really off some of Stuart's
 ideas is that the the indeterministic vintage you're describing the quantum collapse is choosing
 from a menu of possibilities it might be in position it might be in momentum might be in some other
 variable spin whatever and that might not trace back to some cognitive decision that's being made
 so the shaping of the possibilities would be within the the you or in within my my control
 and then the question is what is my control and I think this gets back to what you're saying
 earlier I think you need to talk about free will at the same level ontologically that you're talking
 about um your own emergence so talking about the free will of the of the atoms that make me up
 that's that's the wrong level description to be working on it's a category error
 so I think what I would like to do now is see what kind of questions the audience might have
 for George thank you George definitely I love questions let's give him around to George
 if you have any questions you raise your hand in the meantime I'm going to ask a question to George
 so a mistake that many people make that Scott Erenson points out and I wish more people would
 pay attention to is that okay so if you have free will you're determined by the laws of physics
 or how can you then some people will say okay well there's a scapegoat there's a loophole there
 because you can have non-deterministic physics but then someone will say yeah but then that's random
 so Scott Erenson he can correct me if I'm incorrect would come in and say there's a
 difference between non-deterministic and being random Scott would say that and others would say
 that the there's wiggle room for free will even in even in something that's non-deterministic
 because random could be a subset a non-inclusive subset of what's non-deterministic so what would
 you say to that so are you arguing that there's no free will because of or be at the risk free will
 because of this in determinism or the randomness I'm saying that the argument that look you're
 determined by the laws of physics thus you have no free will okay that's one then some people find
 a way out by saying with quantum mechanics non-deterministic but then the philosopher would chime up and
 say hey yeah but non-deterministic means random you don't have control over what's random
 then the Scott Erenson would pop up and say yeah but non-deterministic is not the same as randomness
 randomness means you have a known probability distribution and that's entirely different than
 being non-deterministic for more information on the in equivalency between non-deterministic
 and randomness check out Scott Erenson's physics 7 7 1 lecture number 18 which has been transcribed
 and is on his blog link in the description so in my earlier remarks I kind of assume that there
 is a probability distribution that is shaped by your your prior behavior so you have to have some
 there has to be some kind of causal connection between your deliberations decisions the process
 that you go through and the the actual decision that emerges and that hopefully you can you can
 execute so just you can't break the causation entirely within your own kind of ability to act
 in the world you're an agent in the world you have to bit act in the world you have to bit act on
 the basis of your deliberations and if you can do that you would be free in least in my naive
 compatibleist reading. We have a question from Stuart Hammeroff.
 Thank you thank you Kurt thank you George Susan. Actually two comments as far as non-deterministic
 versus random or probabilistic excuse me Penrose defines non-computability as somewhere in between
 and what that means I think is it appeals to some other value system something outside the
 algorithmic system so non-algorithmic is probably a better better choice but it's also not random
 but it's it's maybe deterministic in some other value system like space-time geometry maybe
 platonic values that sort of thing that influence our choices if we're conscious and just let that
 happen. The other thing I want to say about free will is that if we do something in if we perceive
 something rapidly it takes several hundred milliseconds for that activity that seems to correlate with
 consciousness to occur in the brain but we often respond in less than 100 milliseconds and this has
 led most I don't know about most but many philosophers to say that consciousness is epiphenomenal and
 free will is absent that we're acting non-consciously and have this false illusion that we're acting
 consciously and Benjamin Libet did a lot of work on this and the move the finger thing is a red
 herring forget that go back to his earlier work with the patients in under in surgery awake with
 their brain exposed where he showed backward time effects that in order to have a a real-time
 experience at the time of the evoke potential 30 milliseconds you needed 500 milliseconds of
 activity and he concluded that it was referred backward in time to the presence who we had act
 in real time and the question is can you have free will without backward time effects because
 Penrose has shown that there's retroactivity and he's been talking about this recently including his
 chapter in Chiangao's book about backward time effects so the question is can you have at least
 for real real time activities you know if something you ponder for for days or something that's
 what I'm talking about something that happens right away can that happen without can you have
 free will without backward time effects I mean this is above my pay grade I should say but I
 my my feeling would be absolutely yes and I can
 evade the particular argument having to do with Libet which is already controversial
 by going to other kinds of decisions that I make that I'm deliberating on I want to buy a new car
 which car do I buy do I buy the end you know x or or y and that's not subject to the same kind
 of time constraints that you're describing here so so I'm talking about for real time for like
 hitting hitting a tennis ball hitting a baseball or something like that well already I frankly if
 I'm playing tennis properly I should be hitting that without any conscious choice at all
 it shouldn't be free it's just a muscle kind of effect I'm well but you said whether to go
 baseline or or or cross court something like exactly exactly I should be thinking out
 strategically more and it's only when I'm learning and they're sending me a million
 forehand shots that I'm I'm having to think it through that consciously well just be aware that
 most people would say it's impossible and that's a situation and therefore consciousness is up
 you family and that's not that's not necessarily so at least you know so I think
 the kind of definition I gave earlier again capsule and simplified consciousness is in
 the loop that we're talking about a conscious deliberation to do a particular action the
 conscious diversions based on my desires my knowledge what I had for breakfast any any kind
 of random influence that could be quite impulsive on my on my end yeah but you still have to process
 what you're responding to is yes and I think the process takes at least a third of a second
 right so within the window they'll live it's talking about we respond in less than 100 milliseconds
 seemingly consciously okay all right who has another question I can't help but but kind of
 notice if I just kind of disengage from this and if I was just somebody who was you know layman
 whatever walking in in all seriousness it sounds like we're just we all just got stone and we're
 talking about stuff like that you know but but in a very serious way because I feel like that way
 that we we look at things and we interpret things is half the problem so when people talk about free
 will determinism all these different things it's like what do you actually mean how hard is it to
 just figure out put it down on a piece of paper document whatever what do you actually mean because
 before we can try and prove all these things and do all these you know things that we hope to get
 value out of what are we actually doing can somebody tell me you know what what is free will
 what is freedom what is determinism what is non-determinism like people have so many different
 interpretations and definitions may I say something as a philosophy professor I love that
 and I think it's so important that we do understand what we're talking about when we're talking about
 free will and consciousness and whatnot and you know one of the key issues even in intro to philosophy
 is how to understand free will and you're absolutely right that unless we have common ground on what
 we're talking about we won't be able to settle the disputes but you're right I mean this this
 particular conversation jumped in it's like in in in action right it's like the beginning of a
 movie where they're just in the action so we we didn't slay the groundwork that you would do if
 okay Tuesday you know we're going to talk about free will and that's in the syllabus and we're
 going to read frankford and we're going to read whatever writings are written on this
 I think the general free will discussion I don't want to derail this Q&A too much why don't we
 we will have a coffee break and we'll talk about definitions or free will do we have a
 copy date for that yes so yeah I very much am on the same page as he I'm still waiting for
 for definitions of consciousness from last year's mind fest nobody got back to me I was
 asking I was asking a couple of professors about their definition of consciousness and what constitutes
 a conscious an example of a conscious object and an example of a non conscious object I I'm still
 waiting for the response so I have two I have two questions one is about the multiple theories
 which is nice super exciting and so on what what I would like to see is a an associated curriculum
 of testability because it's kind of like art and science like as an arts as an arts person I can
 draw whatever it doesn't have to be grounded in reality as a scientist I have to work within
 the possibilities of my current way so what I would like to say to see each theory associated
 with our potential methods of testability of this theory because unless we have testability
 it's a nice theory and they can be beautiful but we cannot act on them it's not actionable
 insight so I would like to see actionable insight in in that the third the the my second question is
 is about the free will I think it it implies some extra physical thing like the like the
 distinction of of brain and consciousness so independent certain independence of consciousness
 from from the brain so that's my conjecture and question really great points we're going to
 the three of us are going to sit down to talk about free will and anyone else of course is welcome
 to join that I I firmly think that free will is physical I don't think unless you we exhaust
 every possibility we don't have to go anything extra physical or dualist to understand free will
 I think it will ultimately come from an understanding of our own minds our own volition
 and I think definitions are great really I was having this debate with the mathematician friend
 over the weekend she was like define define define and that's how mathematicians operate
 they make definitions prove theorems more definitions more theorems etc I think physicists maybe
 philosopher worked out with physicists are a little bit more loose and maybe sloppy actually
 definitely sloppy about this if sometimes we just jump in and try to explain areas and I do think
 that although definitions are important we shouldn't get too hung up on them we shouldn't
 parallelize ourselves for the because we can't define consciousness which is it
 you know something extremely difficult to define free will free will is probably something we should
 define before we debate it I agree but consciousness I think we probably can go on our intuitions
 for the time being tests yes and I would make the same sharp distinction in art and science
 as you were suggesting I think science is an imaginative act especially theoretical science
 that to create a theory is to go beyond it's to imagine something that hadn't been there an idea
 that hadn't been there and then the idea should be subject to to test and often it's not obvious
 how to test something but ultimately at every scientist you know every is a strong word you know
 nine and a point I would say ultimately yes it should be subjected to an empirical test and all
 these theories we've been considering I've been mentioning are indeed testable in that sense so
 Stuart when he's talking about his and Rogers view has a number of tests stopping to do with
 effective anesthetic on microtubules having to do with these oscillations he's observing that
 between the high frequency those are the tests of that integrated information theory and these
 other theories of consciousness likewise have their tests and you're right to hold their feature
 the fire and you better show me how to test these theories or then you know come back to me later

 monarch money dot com slash podcast okay we have a question at the back
 yeah let me see if i can formulate this um this isn't relations to what you mentioned have been
 a generalist um i'm coming from the point of view of competence and we've been doing some research
 and looking at things from a race management standpoint in which looks at surgeons basketball
 players and formula one drivers and they actually commit when they get the competence they commit
 it to the subconscious but in the first moment they bring it back to conscious they commit errors
 that could be fatal so there's a lot of high competence people that operate from this
 discussions at a nanosecond uh reaction to be able to control and so there's a space in between
 and i don't know if that's something that you can speak to or you know anything about
 so the process of do you mean the process of learning a field before you gain competence
 what it what has been studied is that risk goes high up when somebody doubts and then brings
 something from the subconscious to the conscious and now they know that steps and they start following
 steps but when they were in the subconscious and they did it automatically it's just pure
 competence and pure talent and pure skill and whatever you want to call it but once it moves
 from one hemisphere to another it's uh it's kind of like um you know the learning you're trying to
 do it again doubt comes in and you can make mistakes and things like that yeah i mean this is
 arguably one of the reasons that we we humanity or primates whatever evolve consciousness
 in order to aid learning so when we're learning something we're highly conscious of it and we tend
 to overthink it and that's you wouldn't want the surgeon to be in that condition when they're even
 the the student or the resident to be in that condition when they're operating on you they want
 them to be extremely practiced so they actually don't have to think at least at the kind of
 scalpel mechanistic level to to do that so there's at some point of which things pass back out of
 our consciousness and or we at least elevate to a different perspective on on what we're doing
 yeah i have two questions but i'll keep them short um the first one is related to consciousness
 collapsing the wave function i don't really understand the argument beyond some things
 unknown that collapses the wave function we don't know what consciousness is therefore they must be
 the same thing and the reason i'm picking on that a little bit i want you to explain to me why it's
 particularly consciousness because people do this all the time with aliens we don't know what it is
 therefore aliens right so i think there's a lot of things where the unknown becomes a placeholder
 instead of just saying it's unknown and we need to develop new ideas um so i'd like your comment
 on that george and then the second one is related to this concept of free will i really liked what
 you said about how much your most of your free will is not what happens in this instant but like what
 you plan ahead for and so it seems to me that the horizon of free will is more open in the future
 i can't change where i am right now i can't be in arizona but i could plan you know ahead to be there
 right so um so that makes it seem to me that free will is not explainable with quantum mechanics
 because quantum mechanics doesn't have that long time horizon and i don't know if you have any
 thoughts on that also that's interesting my i mean this is again my feeling uninformed perhaps or
 somewhat like a little bit informed but not as informed as the philosophers
 that free will doesn't have anything to do with quantum mechanics it's it's won't only have a kind
 of cognitive or emotional perhaps explanation that will be something to do with the makeup of our
 psyche and their attribution of agency to ourselves so i don't think the the time frame of quantum
 mechanics is relevant or even that of classical physics for that for that matter but that's again
 my unformed unformed view those who are experts should definitely will join our little discussion
 group later on that so i think that the conscious this causes collapse hypothesis is more than the
 minimization of mystery issue and maybe maybe the alien example is instructive so
 the pilot saw flying saucer skip across this the sky must be aliens
 okay we we recognize that in for instance as is fallacious but there still is the observable
 there namely they saw something bounce across the sky they saw high atmospheric lightning for
 example they saw some phenomenon observe phenomenon and that is properly the subject of science
 so i think the pilot comes back and files a report or the navy saw that funny tick-tack thing
 they should come back and say oh they saw something probably the interpretation is is hasty shall
 we say at the very least it's not an alien spacecraft extraterrestrial spacecraft
 but they nonetheless saw a weird tick-tack or they nonetheless saw a flying saucer or
 something that looks saucer like in the sky let's explain that so i think we had to be careful in
 when these claims are presented to us to take out from the claim that which is valuable for the
 progress of science and and bracket that which is not and maybe we'll come around
 at extraterrestrial hypothesis after exhausting every single other one right so with
 the collapse of the wave function this is all i'm suggesting here and
 alpha me to be the one that suggested von Neumann suggested it um vigner suggested it that
 it seems on the face of it according again to kind of a uh of von Neumann
 or formulation upon mechanics that there is a role for the observer that there's one rule
 that you apply and this is in the Schrodinger picture but something similar for the Heisenberg
 picture that is one rule that you apply for the evolution of objects the Schrodinger equation
 and then you measure something and take a sample from the distribution and that's what
 that's what we say according to the the the born rule now
 one reading of that is that consciousness does have or something associated with
 consciousness is probably the better way of putting it something about either integrated
 information if you ascribe to that theory or or um whatever theory of consciousness is
 is saying consciousness is associated with some physical observable
 information integration that integration of information makes that system more susceptible
 causing a collapse i mean i'm sure you could tell some kind of causal story with that
 but it's a it's a testable it's a testable hypothesis and it's been dismissed perhaps rightly
 for decades in physics but i really was it david word david has oh there he is
 can can defend it better than i he and kelvin suggested well okay maybe it's wrong but at least
 now it's become testable because you can say here are systems with dairies degrees of integration
 of information let's see whether they change the time scale of collapse so you brought that back
 into empirical science and to me that's a that's a valid research program we have a question from
 karat i will keep it brief because we can talk later uh but thank you for your talk and um
 i guess maybe my question is a little bit more about maybe the selection process of the buffet
 right so you're saying in some ways that approach to that and maybe it's more of a bird's eye question
 maybe a little bit maybe what your impressions are in the current state of like
 but there are many different theories of consciousness right and i think we tend to right if we find
 the one that we like we maybe stick with that bed bug right we want to itch that itch and go for
 it terrible terrible i know but it feels like that we kind of come i've had my times with certain
 day right so um i guess what i'm asking is in some ways right you're saying and the part of the
 book is you know what is it about how we're now looking at consciousness or relooking at the mind
 we're trying to explain say something in physics or quantum mechanics what why is that even happening
 and i'm wondering based off of the different theories that you approach to i mean i know
 talked about it and different ones and also um street hammerhouse or corer i'm wondering you know
 do you think actually that does have implications for what we think consciousness is right because
 all these theories have a very different way of defining consciousness in some ways putting
 ourselves back in the equation in terms of what we're thinking about the mind definitely comes with
 a lot of kind of theoretical baggage in a way right how do you define consciousness right so
 my at there are certain things that are kind of indubitable and accept right i can't come up with
 reasons why but it's a very specific understanding of consciousness so i'm wondering is it all
 theories of consciousness right that put us back into the equation so to speak or is it just certain
 ones how would you sort of characterize i guess that buffet plate right because i can see right
 maybe global workspace doing well no i don't know where you don't go back into putting ourselves
 in the equations so to speak but i could see something like it right kind of being amenable to
 that sort of thing so i'm kind of curious about that um process yeah so i guess there's kind of
 two questions here what are we even by the title and how is that relevant to my choice and then
 maybe more broadly how do i make choices in this and that's you know an ineffable in a way or
 a test to do with my my interests at a given time um but let me just answer a slightly
 oblique question if i make because that's what you always do with questions um namely no no
 namely that i think the study of consciousness is in still a form of the phase and there aren't
 really great tests for there's questions of whether it's testable or the different theories are
 testable at all so i think it's a let the flowers bloom kind of scenario we should look at these
 various theories i chose in my book it focused really on two integrate information theory and
 then carl fristons and and and other nandy clerks and others views on predictive coding
 predictive processing because they struck me as the ones that are physicsy and that was my own
 interest i left out global workspace although i'm actually writing about it now for scientific
 american i think it's a fascinating approach higher order theories as well so or i do of course
 include oracle or ours well because it's physics oriented so that was my my criterion for this book
 was whether there's a physicsy component to it in other words is it quantitative does it
 involve the kind of systems of physics traditional studies and therefore its tools are applicable
 uh to but i'll pick your brain later okay we only have time for one quick question and that's all
 so i appreciate all your comments i'm not a physicist but i was trained as a psychologist so
 the way i interpolate what you're saying is i think in terms of perception
 at specifically my question has to do with perception below the level of individual
 conscious awareness intuition if you will or when i was in graduate school we work with
 t's to kiss the scopes you know all of that so how does that fit into your framework and your
 understanding of consciousness so quite how does these events that are occurring too fast for
 us to consciously register fit into a theory of consciousness i mean they have to be compatible
 with that theory i don't really address that in in my own thinking or or the book um you know the
 more general question and this goes back to the title of the book that i'm asking is how can the
 external observable objective view that science traditionally tree seeks to develop be be reconciled
 with an internal subjective and kind of interiority of our experience and that goes beyond questions
 of i mean obviously it's sharpest in the in the understanding consciousness and the hard problem
 of mind but it goes beyond that and that's actually the kind of broader point i wanted to make
 namely how does a concept of observer need to be brought into certain quantum mechanics but also
 cosmology and and other domains are understanding time what is time what is space and there i do
 think the kind of considerations you're talking about with perception would come in because they're
 not really talking about consciousness as such i'm talking about all the habits of mind all the
 filters that are perception create and the the illusions and the misperceptions or the
 misapprehension maybe is a better word um misinterpretations of the world that we that we
 make so yes i do think that those insights from cognitive psychology are crucial to the broader
 program of reconciling the interior and the exterior okay give a huge round of applause to both Susan
 Snyder this book it's called putting ourselves back in the equation the link is on screen
 if you're in person you can get George to sign it if you ask nicely enough also very nicely thank
 calm health foundation patrick as well thank you for such a great setup and making this possible
 thank you thank you firstly thank you for watching thank you for listening there's now a website
 kurt gimongol.org and that has a mailing list the reason being that large platforms like youtube
 like patreon they can disable you for whatever reason whenever they like that's just part of
 the terms of service now a direct mailing list ensures that i have an untrammeled communication
 with you plus soon i'll be releasing a one-page pdf of my top 10 toes it's not as quinten tarantino
 as it sounds like secondly if you haven't subscribed or clicked that like button now is the time to do
 so why because each subscribe each like helps youtube push this content to more people like
 yourself plus it helps out kurt directly aka me i also found out last year that external links
 count plenty toward the algorithm which means that whenever you share on twitter say on facebook or
 even on reddit etc it shows youtube hey people are talking about this content outside of youtube
 which in turn greatly aids the distribution on youtube thirdly there's a remarkably active
 discord and subreddit for theories of everything where people explicate toes they disagree respectfully
 about theories and build as a community our own toe links to both are in the description
 fourthly you should know this podcast is on itunes it's on spotify it's on all of the audio platforms
 all you have to do is type in theories of everything and you'll find it personally i
 gain from rewatching lectures and podcasts i also read in the comments that hey toll listeners also
 gain from replaying so how about instead you re-listen on those platforms like itunes spotify google
 podcasts whichever podcast catcher you use and finally if you'd like to support more conversations
 like this more content like this then do consider visiting patreon.com/kurtjemongal
 and donating with whatever you like there's also paypal there's also crypto there's also just
 joining on youtube again keep in mind it's support from the sponsors and you that allow me to work
 on toe full-time you also get early access to add free episodes whether it's audio or video it's
 audio in the case of patreon video in the case of youtube for instance this episode that you're
 listening to right now was released a few days earlier every dollar helps far more than you think
 either way your viewership is generosity enough thank you so much

 Well, there's a lot going on in the world.
 Iran recently attacked Israel to minimal effect happily.
 I think there's one casualty at this point.
 Anyway, there'll be more to say about that soon enough.
 I will wait until I can do a proper podcast on the topic of Iran and what to do about it.
 Today I'm speaking with Cal Newport.
 Cal is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University,
 where he is also a founding member of the Center for Digital Ethics.
 Cal is also a New York Times bestselling author and a frequent contributor to The New Yorker.
 He also hosts the Deep Questions Podcast.
 And Cal's most recent book is Slow Productivity, the Law Start of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
 And we talk about the book today.
 We generally discuss information technology and the cult of productivity.
 We talk about the state of social media, the academic and exile effect,
 free speech and moderation, the effect of the pandemic on knowledge work.
 And then we get into his book.
 We talk about Jane Austen as an example of traditional productivity,
 managing up in an organization, defragmenting one's work life,
 doing fewer things, reasonable deadlines, trading money for time,
 how we will find meaning in a post-scarcity world, the anti-work movement,
 the effects of artificial intelligence on knowledge work, and other topics.
 And I bring you Cal Newport.
 [MUSIC]
 I am here with Cal Newport.
 Cal, thanks for joining me again.
 Sam, it's always a pleasure to talk with you.
 So we're going to talk about your new book, Slow Productivity,
 the Law Start of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
 But before we do, I first have to thank you.
 I think I must have thanked you by email in the intervening year and
 a half since we last spoke.
 But you, as you know, you were the final domino to fall that led me to get off Twitter.
 And as I've said, really every time I've touched this topic on this podcast and
 elsewhere, I'm just embarrassed to have discovered what a great life hack that was.
 It was diagnostic of how much a problem Twitter had become for me.
 But I just must thank you for your influence and your wisdom on that front and
 your actual intervention.
 I mean, you just straight up told me you thought I should get off Twitter in our
 podcast and your voice was definitely in my head when I finally pulled the plug.
 So thank you.
 >> I mean, you're welcome.
 I enjoyed and found fascinating the reaction to you leaving Twitter.
 I don't know if this is how you experienced it.
 But to me, it's what I imagine it's like when your buddy at the bar stops drinking.
 Because people got mad that you left out.
 I can't imagine being mad about someone stopping doing something.
 But people is as if they took it personally as far as I could tell.
 What do you mean you're leaving Twitter?
 What's wrong?
 I thought that was as instructive as hearing about what your experience has been
 like after you left.
 >> Yeah, people did get mad and from the top down, Elon Musk was one of the people
 who got quite mad.
 It was interesting to me, obviously much of the reaction I didn't see because I was
 no longer on Twitter.
 But I got a lot of it in my inbox.
 Many people immediately reached out worried that I was suffering some kind of mental
 health crisis.
 How do you delete your Twitter account apart from being in extremis?
 But it's been wholly good and has allowed me to not just pay attention more to things
 I actually care about.
 But it's allowed me to reflect on what my engagement with Twitter had become.
 I think people's negative reaction to it is to some degree understandable because my decision
 really wasn't just for me and my perception of what Twitter had done to my own mind.
 It is an implicit and even explicit every time I talk about it, condemnation of what
 I think social media has done to most people on it.
 I think there are some people who have fairly benign experiences on these platforms, but
 for most of the so-called elites, journalists and scientists and public figures who think
 they are condemned to use this so-called digital town square to maintain their reputations
 and build their brands and all of that and to just stay in touch with what's going on
 in the world.
 It has become so dysfunctional and I can't recall if this came up in our conversation,
 but one of the reasons why I left was not so much my awareness of what it had done to
 me, but the obvious evidence of what it was doing to Elon, not as the owner of the platform,
 but just as his most prominent user.
 I just saw it was just staring into the funhouse mirror of his life derangement, which was quite
 obviously happening as a result of his addiction to the platform.
 I then began to reflect on the way in which I was sharing in that symptomology, albeit
 somewhat differently, but still, once I pulled the plug, it was like I had almost like a
 digital phantom limb syndrome.
 In fact, it was analogous to amputating a phantom limb because I felt that the pain
 I was experiencing was happening in a space that wasn't quite real ever.
 The digital reputation you imagine you're maintaining isn't quite, you can't quite say
 it's not your reputation, obviously it is your reputation, but it is almost a second
 presence in your mind and life, which doesn't totally map on to your life in real social
 space with real people in the real world.
 Even with the same people who you might be fighting with online when you actually meet
 them face to face, those conversations are different.
 It was like amputating a phantom limb, and I just can't say enough about what a positive
 change has been.
 It's been quite incredible.
 I did some writing about this more recently, and I had you in mind a little bit when I
 was thinking about this.
 I wrote this New Yorker essay late last summer, early fall, and one of the big questions
 I had in there is why did we come to believe that the right way to use the internet to
 have discussions, the sort of surface ideas, the spread news, why did we think the right
 way to do this was to try to get everyone to use the same global platform?
 We take this for granted as like a course, this is what you should do.
 We should have everyone use the same global conversation platform because if we're all
 on the platform, we all can see each other.
 But of course, the reality, and I laid this out of the article, is when you have 500 million
 tweets being generated per day, and the average person is going to see 100 in their feed,
 what you have to do is just incredibly aggressive curation, because you can't have 500 million
 people using the same platform and yet have a sort of globalized centralized zeitgeist
 feed where you're trying to surface a small number of trends for everyone to see.
 This requires incredible curation, this sort of amazing cybernetic part algorithm, part
 human, part network theory powered curation that Twitter uses, and it's of course that
 incredibly aggressive curation that makes this a platform that just fuels outrage, that fuels
 the darker side of people.
 One of the arguments I made in that article is here's what works better, small communities
 that have weak-type connections between them.
 You have lots of small communities online and they have overlapping membership.
 We know from network theory, really interesting ideas can spread to these network of networks.
 Really important news will spread to these network of networks, but most of your interaction
 in this sort of digital vision is going to be with a small number of other people that
 have a sort of emergent shared sort of community standard.
 It's much richer, much more personal.
 That's really what the internet envisioned.
 Everyone is going to have the possibility to be connected to everyone else, not everyone
 actually needs to be directly connected to everyone else on the same platform.
 I've really been thinking about the folly of global conversation platform as one of the
 key follies of the sort of 2010s internet.
 Yeah.
 I think when we last spoke, you were pretty bearish on the major social media networks
 because I think it was because you thought TikTok had successfully disrupted everything
 because they weren't relying on the social graph that you have Facebook and Twitter.
 They had a first mover advantage where they got all of us to build out our social networks
 in this common space.
 That and some algorithmic gaming of the system was really the basis of surfacing content.
 As we all know, it privileged outrage and negatively biased engagement.
 What TikTok did is it just never even went in the direction of establishing a social graph.
 It just used a pure algorithmic surfacing of entertainment.
 In so far as the social media platforms have had to emulate TikTok, I may be Twitter is
 still an exception here, but certainly Facebook or Instagram.
 Do you still think that the writing is still on the wall for the major platforms or do you
 think they're going to figure out how to still claim the better part of humanity for the
 rest of our lives?
 I still feel strong about that hypothesis.
 I mean, I think we see for various reasons, but we see the dethroning of Twitter as having
 that same central cultural status it had before.
 TikTok we see, for example, like my argument was about TikTok is without this entrenched
 advantage of my social graph is in there.
 I've already spent years trying to set up follower networks that I said the connection
 to TikTok would be very superficial and weak and we are seeing that.
 I think last year, for example, there was double digit drops in TikTok users among the
 sort of 20 and especially the upper 20s and in the 30s, that sort of demographic, a sort
 of young adult demographic said enough, and they really had no problem leaving because
 what's actually connecting there, it's a very zeitgeisty platform that people can take
 or leave.
 I mean, Instagram is holding it there.
 But I don't think it has that same against centrality that it might have had two or three
 years ago and the alternatives, independent media, so podcasting email newsletters, these
 really are ascended in the last year, year and a half since we've talked and that's the
 opposite of the centralized platform model because this is independently produced information.
 People discover these things almost entirely through point to point curated trust.
 Someone I know, Ford me an email newsletter I signed up, someone I know told me about
 this podcast.
 I started listening to this podcast.
 They mentioned another podcast.
 Now I listen to that one.
 That distributed trust model of curation as opposed to a centralized algorithmic model,
 I think really works well and we're seeing that.
 So I remain bearish on the idea of a small number of social platforms that dominate internet
 culture.
 Yeah.
 One of the biggest changes for me, which I didn't anticipate was that you're shutting
 down my Twitter account changed my relationship as a producer of content, as a somebody with
 a fairly large platform.
 It changed my relationship to my own engagement with current events and the world of ideas
 and just my audience, it's just changed the time course of everything.
 So when you're on Twitter, you feel an obligation to react to something that everyone is reacting
 to or at least you have to consider whether or not you should.
 So you're just seeing something happens in the news and everyone is forwarding a specific
 article or dunking on some response to current events and you, because it's just implicit,
 you have the platform, you have the massive audience, you're part of this conversation.
 What are you going to say about it?
 And no longer having that outlet, the time course of my response to everything has slowed
 way down.
 And so now I have this podcast and I podcast more or less once a week.
 And so I really have a better part of a week to decide whether I should say anything about
 what just happened in Ukraine or anywhere else.
 And most things, I would say 99% of things don't survive that interval.
 It's just there's no reason for me to react to the thing that happened four days ago.
 And there has been memory hold for almost everyone at this point.
 And so it's just changed my relationship to information, to the news, to my own sense
 of just how I needed to think and talk about things.
 And I really wasn't anticipating that, it just, it was, you know, there's probably something
 lost there.
 I mean, there are moments in public conversation where it's probably an advantage to be able
 to say something immediately and you're part of that first, the first things that are
 getting said or something you're contributing to.
 But I don't know, there's so much more noise than signal there.
 And just the feeling of moving through the day is so different when it's not being punctuated
 by dozens of interruptions, but you know, with just to see what was said or to decide
 whether you're going to say something about this next thing that happened.
 It's just, I mean, honestly, it feels like I've just come out of some kind of decade
 long flirtation with mental illness.
 I mean, I just, it's not actually too strong a way to put it, it's just, it is a profound
 relief.
 I mean, it's a, and a humbling, a humbling one really.
 Yeah.
 Do you find it surprising the number, I'm thinking journalists in particular who very much dislike
 Elon Musk.
 Right.
 They have a sort of moral personal ethical commitment to stop using his platform.
 And they'll still talk about, I don't like what's happening on X, I don't like Elon Musk.
 And yet almost none of them have left.
 I find that interesting.
 I think, again, I think there's something interesting in that where it would, for a lot
 of people who are writing like a tech journalist, business journalist, really dislike, clearly
 dislike Elon Musk still can't bring themselves to leaving the platform, which, which again,
 I think speaks to something interesting about the way the platform plays, especially people
 with some sort of public profile, the way it plays and how they understand their, their
 influence on the world or their impact.
 But that's, to me, that's been the more interesting observation of the post Musk period is actually
 how rare you still are, which is, you know, I thought there'd be a lot more Sam Harris's
 a lot more people saying, yeah, I'm just leaving.
 People are having a hard time.
 Yeah.
 Well, I mean, I do have to recognize that I'm immensely lucky to have already, already
 have built my platform in the ways that I've built it so that I didn't feel that really,
 I was putting anything in jeopardy by just pulling the plug on my, my social media presence.
 I mean, I still have a, a minor presence in, in the sense that, you know, my team puts
 out stuff on, on the various platforms, it just says sheer marketing, right?
 So there's, but those were always much smaller accounts and because everyone knows it's
 not me, you know, people are much less interested in it.
 So, you know, I mean, those are just maintained in a perfunctory way.
 But I think most people who are still building their, their, their reputations as writers
 or journalists or, I mean, certainly people in politics feel that they just can't forsake
 the opportunity to build an audience there or, and they certainly can't pull the plug
 on a large audience already built if they're busy, you know, whittling away on their various
 projects and they just see no other way to, to effectively market them.
 I mean, I just think it's, everyone's been captured by it and what's more there, there
 is just the sense that if you're not there, you don't know what's actually happening as
 soon as you need to know it.
 I mean, especially if you're a journalist and I mean, the thing is that it's so distorting
 of priorities and of, of real information.
 I mean, I see, I see so many people in the podcast space and in, you know, in the alternative
 media space pushed around by misinformation and conspiracy thinking and even when they're,
 you know, occasionally right about something, you know, I mean, occasionally there's a conspiracy
 theory that really turns out to be true.
 It's just so everyone's priorities are so upside down and there's just this, what, what
 has engineered for this, this is now kind of outside of mainstream channels.
 I mean, this wouldn't be true of the New Yorker where you write, but it's just, you
 know, out in what I call podcast, a stand and sub stack a stand, it has created this, this
 new religion of anti-establishment thinking where it's just the alternative explanation
 of everything is the thing that we're now going to spend 90% of our time talking about.
 And it's just so often wrong and misleading and deranging that I mean, really it has made
 me increasingly worried that we have, you know, politically, you know, you know, certainly
 in the aftermath of COVID rendered ourselves almost ungovernable in how we talk about,
 you know, what, what, or, you know, attempt to have a conversation about what used to
 be the world of facts.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think this is one of the more engaging human psychological experiences is this idea
 of most people were thinking this, but then me and my group figured out that that is true,
 right?
 That inversion, the inversion of the, whatever, the empiricism structure is incredibly engaging
 and it occurs every once in a while in reality, like everyone was thinking this and then we
 realized whatever DNA is a double helix and it's like amazing.
 Human culture, especially algorithmic driven online culture has given a way to basically
 commodify that and spread that like that we can, we can create, you can, you can build
 an entire like epistemology around everyone thinks this is true, but it's really that,
 you know, everyone thinks this is bad for you, it's good.
 Everyone thinks like this about this disease, but it's that everyone, you know, thinks that
 and you can build an entire epistemology around that like your entire world can be that and
 there can be a whole audience that's just going to reward that the algorithm is going
 to reward that.
 So I have definitely seen that as well, there, I mean, there's a, there's a well known effect
 among professors, we call the sort of academic and exile or academic in the wilds effect,
 which is if you, if you take an academic and then they leave, they leave academia, you
 know, they go, they go independent eight times out of 10, they go to some really conspiratorial
 places.
 And partially what's going on here is, well, first of all, they're smart.
 So like it completely makes sense to them that I could figure something out that other
 people didn't understand because I'm, I'm very smart.
 But one of the purposes and like services academia plays is there's this checking mechanism.
 Everyone else is smart too.
 And so when you're like, Hey, I think, look, here's this, this whole new way of seeing
 it.
 The earth is hollow.
 You have all these other smart people being like, here's why you're dumb and they take
 you down, right?
 But when you leave, you have this academic and exile and this is sort of like Linus Pauline
 with vitamin megadosing, right?
 It's much, much higher rate now in the age of social media because now when you leave,
 you can immediately algorithmically have constructed an audience that cheers you on.
 Yeah.
 And so now I think the severity of academic and exile effect is much more pronounced and
 much more ubiquitous than it used to be that when you sort of leave academia to start your
 podcast, it's not too long until, you know, there's world changing conspiracies that you're
 uncovering and it could be medical and it could be governmental and it doesn't matter.
 And so I think that effect is like one of the more interesting effects has been happening
 is that you can get a cheering section and the algorithmically constructed cheering section
 of people that you're being rewarded for saying, I think this is the way it really happens.
 And you know, you see this all the time, I think, I like podcasts to stand as a term.
 This idea of there can be a hundred studies saying something, but if there's one study
 saying something different, the way you perceive that is, well, everyone knows now that things
 not true.
 It's this interesting sort of sampling of evidence, this sort of destabilization of
 Bayesian priors that is amplified and supported in sort of the world of algorithmically discriminated
 or algorithmically disseminated information.
 Yeah.
 That's really interesting.
 Yeah.
 This is a, you just described an effect that I've referred to, I believe previously as watching
 people get radicalized by their own audience, right, I mean, that cheering section has the
 effect of it.
 People notice the signal in their own audience and they begin to cater to that signal.
 And then there's just this, this ratchet effect where it just gets, you know, crazier and crazier
 and there's more and more sunk cost reputationally for having been the guy who was sure that there's
 so many examples of this in the midst of COVID that focus on vaccines and medical conspiracies,
 etc.
 You're just, you go all in and then you would have to completely repudiate how you spent
 the last 12 months if you were going to have a second thought and it was going to talk
 any sense into you.
 So there's one thing that reliably confuses people here around the norms of our online
 conversation and it's the analogy of Twitter being the so-called digital town square and
 this notion that a commitment to free speech should more or less bar the door to any kind
 of, you know, real moderation policy, right?
 Like what you want is a total free for all where the best idea wins and sunlight is the
 best disinfectant, right?
 So we should be able to entertain any notion at whatever scale for however long in proximity
 to any other world events and any effort to put your thumb on the scale to deplatform
 Alex Jones or to try to clean up a digital sewer that's introducing bias by definition
 and worse, it's actually just a repudiation of free speech in the constitutional sense
 and it's forsaking the best error correcting mechanisms we have which are just let everything
 suffer collision with everything else and see what wins, right?
 And so the people never, when they're championing this commitment to something like free speech
 absolutism, they never take a moment to recognize that there are places online that are much
 closer to the absolute than Twitter ever was and no one wants to be there.
 I mean, places like 4chan and 8chan, I mean, that's where you really get your absolutes,
 right?
 Well, you can just, you know, I mean, everything up to child pornography is my populate your
 feed but there's also just this point that is also overlooked which you just referenced
 which is the algorithmically boosted aspect of the speech which changes the nature of
 what speech is online so perhaps you could just give me your thoughts on how you view
 this tension between our commitment to free speech or commitment to leveraging the wisdom
 of the crowd insofar as it exists and to correcting errors at scale but this need to not suffer
 the 4chanification of everything in our digital lives.
 Yeah, well, I think the town square, it's a town square analogy that's causing the problem
 here, right?
 I mean, the concept of a town square, the sort of central gathering place where people
 can democratically discuss depends on scale being reasonable, right?
 I mean, we call it the town square, we don't call it the city or the state square, right?
 Because it's a place where the demos and Athens, we sort of a relatively constrained group
 of people who all know each other and have other ties to each other.
 You have other social trust ties to each other.
 We live in the same town.
 I run the hardware store that you come to to buy your nails, them to come together, there's
 this free speech notion of well, we don't want to by fiat in advance say here are topics
 that are off limits because how are we going to work together to advance what we understand?
 Twitter is not a town square, right?
 We have 500 million users, that's not a town square, it's an entertainment product.
 We have 500 million users who are inputting lots of different possible bits of content
 that could be interesting.
 We're going to run them through this cybernetic curation algorithms.
 This is what I mean by that is there's algorithms involved, but it's also the expansion properties
 of the underlying follower graph means that individual decisions to retweet or not retweet.
 So these are human decisions interacting with these digital networks can create these cascades
 of information spreading.
 That's a lot about how trends arise.
 It's a really powerful actual curation mechanism.
 It's unlike TikTok, which is purely algorithmic on Twitter, it's cybernetic and so you have
 these digital networks with good expansion properties and 100 million people making individual
 decisions whether or not they click retweet or not, whether to quote tweet or not, which
 is a whole interesting sort of computer science question.
 All of this aimed towards how can we take this giant pool of potential content and choose
 this sort of small number of streams of content that are going to be relatively globalized
 or interesting and engaging.
 That's not a town square, it's an entertainment product.
 It's why in a New Yorker piece I wrote right after Musk took over Twitter is I said it's
 not the town square, it's much more the Colosseum, that's much more the better idea.
 It's tons of people watching carefully curated entertainment.
 In that context, of course, you have all sorts of thumbs on the scale.
 The whole point is we're trying to put on this show and I think of like the trending topics
 of the day as the show on the Colosseum floor with all the huge crowds just watching and
 chiming in to see the blood sport between, ""Hey, Sam, today is having a war with whoever.""
 This is the entertainment for today.
 It's an entertainment product.
 A course of thumb is on the scale because you're trying to find something that just pushes
 the buttons right.
 Maybe there's some outrage but not too much.
 Maybe it's absurd but not in a sort of eight-chan, completely over-the-top, lulls-type absurd.
 You're trying to program a television station.
 You're trying to program entertainment in a Colosseum.
 It's not a town square.
 If you have actual digital town squares, here's a place for a small number of people who other
 ties to each other are gathering to think things through and talk things through.
 We've seen examples of those can have a wide variety of different community standards,
 including standards where almost anything is going to go on this discussion group but
 it works because we're all whatever.
 We're jacks from this part of the country and we have other ties to each other.
 I think it's that town square metaphor that threw us off, because we took this entertainment
 product and somehow tried to make it seem like this was the Roman Senate.
 This is where just this reasonable-scaled group of people were getting together to hash
 things out.
 That's never what they were actually trying to do there.
 It seems reasonable to have made this mistake.
 The structure you're positing, like a network of networks online, that at least is implied
 on Twitter because you have the people you're following and you have the people who are
 following you.
 That's not all of Twitter.
 You're just tending to see what you're following and everyone who's following you sees what
 you react to and that's its own little space.
 Why is that so easily corrupted by being in contact with the rest of the ocean of information?
 What ends up happening on Twitter is that more local interactions just get swamped out by
 the ultra-amplified content, and increasingly their feed is driven by this.
 There's some stuff in there from people you straight follow, but the feed is algorithmically
 sorted and one of the major criteria on which things are sorted for your feed is their engagement
 across the network.
 Really what's happened is it's the content that has really gained this big boosting effect,
 this cascade of retweets leading the retweets, that's what's being programmed for.
 There's some conceptual regionalization, if you follow a lot of a certain type of people,
 you might be seeing what's really being amplified in that subgroup.
 There's some of that going on as well, but it's a really large scale at which a lot of
 this is happening and especially when it comes to the most town square piece of this, which
 is discussions of politics, discussions of policy, discussions of world events, the stuff
 we think of as the grist of civic discussion.
 Those are incredibly large sub-networks in which information is spreading and that's
 where you really have the Coliseum affected.
 It's people competing to get their turn on the Coliseum floor, they have their Trident
 ready and that's like that most civic-minded aspect that we associate with Twitter I think
 is the most entertainment centric.
 The most corrupting of our conversation about important topics is because one of the thumbs
 on the scale here is outrage.
 Outrage is a word we keep using in this context and it seems to have been, at least in my
 hearing, it doesn't quite convey the attitude that one sees so often online, which is it
 really is kind of in-group sanctimony and out-group contempt.
 You're expressing contempt for the out-group to your in-group.
 It's a simulacrum of conversation, sometimes you're actually someone responding to somebody
 else, but it's almost always a bad faith response.
 It's a response that is meant to be enjoyed by the in-group that despises the target of
 the remark in the out-group and it's just, it's so obviously driving us apart at the
 level of society, again, not when you're talking about how beautiful full solar eclipse is,
 but when you're talking about politics or anything that is polarizing.
 Yeah.
 No, and I'm with you on this, right?
 It does that.
 It does that.
 And you're auditioning.
 You're auditioning when you comment on someone's tweet.
 You're auditioning for the algorithm, this sort of cybernetic amplification effect.
 Everyone tries to one-up each other.
 I mean, I hear a lot from people, what they're really worried about mainly is not the contempt
 from the other side, but that the in-group policing I think has had a massive impact.
 We see it in journalism, you see it in academia, you see it in sort of theoretical frameworks,
 you certainly see it in some degree in politics, though it's interesting, politicians, they're
 so used to that, it's almost as if they're the one group that at least sort of understands
 the socio-dynamics of something like Twitter.
 This is sort of their lives, is in-group policing, out-group contempt, being okay with these people
 are upset, who am I going to hitch my wagon to, putting their finger to the wind?
 But for most other people aren't used to that, and so it's definitely an effect that
 makes you either cower or makes you conform.
 Look, I only get some taste of this when I'm doing book tours, right?
 Because I'm not on social media, so I'm not subject to people talking about me in these
 sort of contexts.
 When you have a book out, people do talk, you get reviews, and people come out to talk
 about your book or whatever, and I hate it, and I couldn't imagine if that was just all
 the time.
 If all the time, that was the world I was in, is like every week I have to get the two
 or three people that are taking their swing at me or whatever, I mean that would drastically
 affect, I'm sure, what I write about how I went through my life, just the subjective
 well-being.
 Yes, I was really hoping for Elon to destabilize Twitter so much that it essentially collapsed.
 It would actually be a great civic duty that he would have done, but it seems to be holding
 on to some degree, at least as far as I can tell, which is, I think, unfortunate.
 Yeah, well, he's destabilized something, and it's been his own brain, but it's just,
 he really is a cautionary tale at this point, and that has always been my concern about
 his engagement with Twitter, not so much what he was going to do to the platform.
 For the longest time, I remained agnostic as to whether or not he could actually significantly
 improve it.
 It doesn't seem likely to me now, but I'm not really in touch with what it's become,
 but as for its effect on him, one of the most productive people in any generation, it hasn't
 been good.
 It's turned to your book because it's really, I mean, you've written a series of books that
 have targeted the same kind of object here, which is a life well lived, right?
 I mean, the question is, how do we answer the question, what is life good for, right?
 I mean, the people, especially when you get to a certain level of privilege and abundance
 and just sheer good luck, and this is almost by definition much of our audience, you know,
 believe for a podcast like this or for a book like yours, and we're talking about people
 who have the time to think about how to improve their lives and how to live more wisely and
 get to a place where they more and more are not regretting how they use their time.
 There, that does suggest at least a few degrees of freedom there and in the kinds of choices
 they make, you know, presumably if you're listening to this podcast, you're not digging
 a ditch in the sun under the lash of some tyrant, right?
 So you seem to be at least implicitly and rather often explicitly asking these types
 of questions, you know, just like, what is the point of all of this?
 What does winning the game actually look like?
 And in this most recent book, you're talking about a new approach to productivity which,
 you know, you say it's a lost art, so you're suggesting that we were once much better at
 this.
 Let's just start with your basic concept.
 What do you mean by slow productivity and how have we lost touch with it?
 Well, I agree with your characterization of the questions I think about.
 I would add something else to it, which is, you know, as a computer scientist, as a,
 you know, digital theorist, I care in particular how technology intersects with that story as
 well, right?
 So in most of my writing of the last decade, there's usually a unintended consequence of
 a technological development that gets us out of touch or becomes an obstacle to living
 some life that's going to be deeper, more meaningful, and we have to grapple with that
 and understand that technology, the opportunities, the perils, and sort of navigate around it.
 Right?
 So even this book, like slow productivity, the problem that I'm solving, there's actually
 a techno story behind it.
 Right.
 I mean, so there's an easier way of summarizing it, which is, look, there's a key question
 that a lot of people are in, mainly as you say, this sort of knowledge work world, these
 are people who are doing pretty well, right?
 You have a job in which you look at a computer screen and you're an air conditioner, right?
 So a lucky place to be.
 But that group of people, and these are the people, these are a big group of my readers.
 A big question a lot of them have is, okay, how do I do my work well?
 How do I produce things I'm proud of, have impact, you know, support my family, and yet
 not let work just take over all of my life?
 How do I avoid sort of falling into burnout?
 I don't want to be like pre-Twitter Elon Musk and just don't sleep and have seven businesses
 and just get after it.
 Like, how do I still do stuff I'm proud of but also spend time with my kids, right?
 There's this big question and the book looks at that question from both the perspective
 of someone like creatives that have a huge amount of autonomy and also from the perspective
 of sort of a standard office worker who has less autonomy, how can they still sort of
 navigate that, that knife sense.
 But there's a techno story behind how we got to a place where that question became more
 and more relevant and the story that I'm trying to tell in the first part of the book is knowledge
 work itself and that emerged as a major sector which is really like mid-20th century.
 Had this issue of not really knowing how to define productivity because we had industrial
 productivity was a quantitative concept, it's a ratio, it's model T's per paid labor
 hour, agricultural productivity is a quantitative idea, it's a bushels of corn per acre of land,
 you could measure this, industrial manufacturing, agriculture you had well defined production
 systems, so you could tweak something very specific and see how it impacted that number.
 Knowledge work comes along under that works.
 Knowledge work is more haphazard and autonomous and ambiguous.
 I might be working on seven things that are different than the eight things you're working
 on, there's not one thing we're producing, there's no well defined production systems
 we use for our work as well, organizing labor is very independent and individualized in
 knowledge work and so in response to that, the knowledge sector came up with this idea
 of we will use visible activity as a proxy for you doing something useful, so we'll all
 gather in the same building like we would a factory, we'll work factory shift hours and
 if I see you here doing stuff, I'm assuming that's useful stuff and if we need to be more
 productive come early stay late, I call that pseudo productivity, the techno story is that
 worked okay, not great but worked okay until the front office IT revolution of the late
 90s and early 2000s and then once we through network computers and then later mobile computing
 into the sort of office works fear, pseudo productivity spun off the rails, right?
 Because the personal computer came in and now suddenly the amount of different things
 you could work on quadrupled, no longer do we have specialists to type and specialists
 to handle communication, like the amount of work you could do quadrupled, low friction
 communication networks made it really easy to ask people to do things to workload skyrocketed,
 email, chat, really changed the game when it came to demonstrating visible effort, now
 you could be doing this an incredible fine granularity at a frenetic pace, how quickly
 I respond to a message might be really important signal in trying to show how pseudo productive
 I actually am.
 So my argument was the front office IT revolution plus this older idea of pseudo productivity,
 they didn't mix and it led to this increasing exhaustion of knowledge workers as the amount
 of stuff they're working on increased, the amount of their day dedicated to talking about
 work instead of actually doing work increased, the freneticism and speed of their work increased
 at the same time they were getting more nihilistic like what am I actually doing here, I'm just
 doing all these visible signs of productivity, I'm sending emails, I'm in meetings but I'm
 not actually writing the marketing report, I'm not actually programming the computer
 and it led to the burnout epidemic.
 And so there's that underlying techno story of technology plus that crude metric didn't
 work well, so we have to reassess what does it mean to produce really good stuff, can
 we do that in a way that doesn't make work really exhausting, so I have that sort of
 personal angle and then there's also this sort of deeper techno-social economic story
 and they're both circling I think the same issues.
 What did COVID do to this picture, I mean there's this profound change, I mean again
 we're talking about knowledge workers almost by definition here and perhaps you should
 bound that concept for us a little more, but the rise of remote work in the aftermath
 of COVID and the seeming durability of our commitment to that, I mean there's just many
 organizations are still struggling with just how to get the balance right, but there does
 seem to be this hybrid level of commitment to remote and in office work for many organizations.
 And there are upsides and downsides to that, but it does change this, at least the optics
 of pseudo-productivity, I mean you're just, if you're not condemning people to have to
 be at their desk for 40 hours a week, whether that's the best use of their time or not because
 so much of their time is now remote and you're not actually, they don't get the credit for
 being at their desk because there is no desk to be at much of the time and then there's
 this phenomenon of the quiet quitting that has been much discussed.
 How do you view what recent years during and post COVID have done to this conversation?
 I think the beginning of COVID pushed this increasing issue people were having with the
 unsustainability of pseudo-productivity, it pushed it over the edge because a couple things
 happen when knowledge workers had to go remote right away.
 When we were shifting remote, we were already for the most part at our max capacity for
 the amount of work that we could have on our plate at the same time and have any chance
 of not drowning.
 And the reason why we're at max capacity is because in knowledge work, we leave workload
 management up to the individual.
 For the most part, that's up to you to figure out how to manage what you're doing and what
 you say yes to.
 There's a lot of autonomy and ambiguity in knowledge work.
 So how a lot of people began to manage their workloads is they would wait until the stress
 of their workload got high enough that it outweighed their concern about the negative
 social costs of saying no to new work.
 This became the primary governor mechanism by which so many knowledge workers manage
 their workloads.
 So of course, this keeps you at a state of having a stressfully large amount of work.
 If you have to be stressed before you begin to say no, everyone has a stressful amount
 of work, then the pandemic hit, which automatically gave us like 25% more tasks overnight because
 we had to adjust unexpectedly to, oh, we got to run our company to wipe down your groceries.
 Yeah.
 And just work itself.
 Like how do we deliver our services, you know, if I remember this going on at the New
 Yorker, like how do we move our whole production process to like a digital pipeline?
 It was just new work came out of nowhere.
 The collaboration then also became less efficient because we lost all of the, oh, I see your
 office door is open.
 So I'll hook my head in and be like, hey, what are we going to do about this client and it
 takes two minutes?
 Instead, we had to start scheduling zoom meetings, but the smallest granularity of these meetings
 was a half hour because it's hard to drag anything smaller on your calendar.
 And so now we were making the collaboration, the overhead related to work.
 That became a lot less efficient.
 And then finally to compensate for the fact that I can't see you doing visible activity.
 We just moved this over to being even more phonetic with digital communication.
 Like I really now is important for me not to reply quickly, like I have to reply very
 quickly to slack because like this is maybe the only way I have right now to demonstrate
 that I'm being pseudo productive, right?
 So all these things happened overnight and people just said enough is enough.
 And I actually argue this is a, you know, a piece I wrote a couple months ago.
 I argued that many of these sort of spasmatic emergent grassroots revolution reform movements
 and work that we saw throughout the pandemic period where in part people responding in
 a primal way to this I've been pushed over the edge with what's going on in knowledge
 work.
 So I think the knowledge work component of the great resignation was a response.
 The people saying enough is enough.
 I think quiet quitting was a response for the younger generation who couldn't resign
 or switch down the half hours and moved to a cabin.
 So quiet quitting was a response.
 I think much of the fury around the remote work wars that really picked up steam in 2021
 and 2022 was also a sort of misguided response to this deeper primal rejection of work has
 just become sort of intolerably frenetic and overloaded.
 I'm getting actually almost no real work done.
 Objectively the remote work wars didn't make a ton of sense, right?
 You have this thing that did not exist 16 months earlier.
 And now you had worker groups talking about it like it was a Geneva convention.
 It was just like fundamental right that a course work is supposed to happen at home.
 How could we ever take this away?
 This didn't even exist, you know, 16 months earlier.
 I think part of that was just a generalized zeal for reform because when we took this
 already sort of exhausting tempo and this nihilism of all we do is talk about work
 and rarely get work done, when we push that over the edge in the pandemic, it broke a
 lot of people and a lot of the unrest we saw in the knowledge work sector throughout
 the pandemic I think was people just responding to enough is enough but they didn't really
 know exactly what they were responding to and I think a lot of those efforts were sort
 of misguided energy and we missed a lot of the opportunities we had to really make
 better reform here.
 That's the context in which I was thinking about slow productivity.
 Well, let's talk about the principles of achieving slow productivity.
 What is signified by the phrase and you frame your discussion around many interesting case
 studies.
 The main being John McPhee but you talk about Benjamin Franklin and Jane Austen and a bunch
 of scientists and it does suggest, I mean this is really your thesis, you talk about
 the ways in which our engagement with new information technology has deranged our sense
 of what it is to be productive and how we measure success and so if you go far enough
 back in time it's not a surprise that you see examples of people who didn't have this
 technology who were succeeding by the lights of history in spectacular ways at a very different
 cadence with respect to how they worked.
 Feel free to bring up any of the principle case studies you want but we should talk about
 your three stages here, do fewer things, work at a natural pace and obsess over quality.
 Yeah, I mean and the reason, I mean because it was a big decision but the reason I chose
 to use is the primary case studies, these sort of historical figures.
 There's really two aspects of that that I think is important to sort of set the stage.
 One I was wary of the uncanny valley effect, I've seen this a lot when talking about sort
 of contemporary work.
 There's an uncanny valley effect if you say look I'm going to tell you about a company
 that exists right now that's doing things differently or a specific employee at a marketing company
 and here's how they do things differently.
 Their job is so similar to yours that the differences really begin to matter and people
 have a hard time getting past like oh but that's a client service firm and our client,
 we have a timesheet firm and it's actually I found it's difficult for people to get past
 that uncanny valley.
 It's too close, if it's too close to what they do but not exactly what they do it becomes
 an unbridgeable or disorienting gap.
 So I said why don't I look at what I call traditional knowledge workers who are actually
 defined by, this could be the critique but I'm twisting the critique to be a benefit.
 They're defined by all the freedom and autonomy they had to experiment with what's the best
 way to create value using my brain.
 I said this is why these people are important because they had all the freedom in the world
 to figure out what works so if we look at what they settled on they're probably uncovering
 some useful universal principles about the best way of creating valuable things using
 the human brain.
 Now what we could then do is once we isolate those principles I can do the hard work of
 okay so how can we make that relevant to someone who works in a cubicle, how can we
 make that relevant to an entrepreneur in 2024.
 Yeah there's a lot of work then to translate those principles to tactical things that makes
 sense to people today but I thought that was the right way to do it.
 So those three principles you mentioned were the three big things that came up if you study
 historically people who were good with creating valuable things with their brain they didn't
 work on too many things at the same time they really avoided overload.
 Their pace was varied, hard periods, less hard periods also they would measure productivity
 on very large time scales so many of the most productive people in history.
 If you go back and look at a random month in their life they seem incredibly non productive
 right because they didn't think about productivity in terms of like today needs to be productive
 if they thought about it like the next 10 years I want to produce something that matters
 and then finally they cared a lot about craft right that that was a sort of antidote to
 the appeal of busyness was to instead reorient their interests towards I want to do something
 really well and I want to keep better at what I'm doing.
 All three of those principles I argue can be first adapted to modern knowledge workers
 with a lot of freedom and then can be further adapted even to knowledge workers who are
 in a situation where they have less freedom.
 We can get ideas from there that transmute into interesting tangible advice for people
 in various situations in our current moment.

 Okay, a little housekeeping here.
 How shall I put this?
 Well, for those of you who heard my previous episode with Rory Stewart,
 this might come as a bit of a surprise.
 I thought that was a great conversation, as did many of you.
 I said really everyone, as far as I can tell.
 I'll remind you Rory is a fascinating person who spent something like 20 months walking across the Middle East.
 And wrote a book about his travels in Afghanistan in particular.
 His wide experience in the Muslim world served in Iraq for the British Civil Service.
 And we talked about many things in this podcast.
 And touched on my concerns about jihadism fairly briefly.
 We spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes, and maybe it was 20 minutes of that conversation that we focused on jihadism.
 The general focus was on just the failures of nation building in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 And the unraveling of the rules-based international order.
 We spoke about Brexit and how odious partisan politics have become.
 There were many other topics.
 And what was notable is that we basically agreed about everything except we had a clear difference of emphasis.
 I tend to emphasize the ideological origins of certain types of violence.
 I'm very concerned about extreme religious beliefs and how they're motivating.
 And of course I acknowledge that there are other sources of human conflict.
 Tribalism, nationalism, sociopathy, et cetera.
 And in the context of our conversation, Rory was emphasizing the importance of nationalism,
 which he thinks is a bigger variable.
 Even in the history of our conflicts in the Muslim world.
 Now that is certainly debatable, but in our conversation, he wasn't denying the importance of religious ideology.
 And I wasn't denying the importance of nationalism.
 If we were disagreeing at all, it was simply a matter of how much we waited each of those variables.
 So anyway, I thought it was a great conversation.
 But someone surfaced some remarks that Rory made on his own podcast later that week.
 Rory is speaking here with Humsa Yusuf, who is a Muslim Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland
 and the leader of the Scottish National Party.
 And I'm otherwise unfamiliar with Humsa, but you'll hear some of his remarks for context.
 One of the things that I've noticed recently, particularly since October 7th,
 is an increase in people making stereotypical comments about Muslims.
 I mean, I just did an interview with an American podcast guy called Sam Harris,
 who was hammering me for nearly an hour saying, ""Yes, but surely, Rory, you have to admit there's a connection between Muslims and suicide bombers and Muslims and terrorists.
 You just wouldn't let it go.""
 And I wondered, is that something that you've experienced and is it something that's getting better, getting worse?
 How does our society deal with it?
 I think it's getting worse.
 Maybe it comes in cycles.
 But I remember for me, 9/11 was such a seminal moment for me.
 And that makes end of it kind of selfish, thousands of miles away and affected and killed so many thousands of Americans.
 But for me, it was a day I'll always remember when 9/11 took place, one of Tuesday, I think.
 And coming back from school and school bus home, radio was on and you can kind of hear what was going on.
 And the driver was telling us to shop because he was trying to listen to what was going on.
 Went home and saw the scenes as you guys would have seen a terrible tragic and terror type that took place.
 And then the next day, I remember going to school and sitting in a form class.
 And the same two guys, I used to sit beside every single morning.
 And we'd be talking about the things that teenage boys talk about, mainly my case, Celtic and football club I loved.
 And they were bombarding me, not with any maliciousness.
 They were bombarding me with questions that I had no idea the answer to.
 You know, why did Muslims here at America, do you know who was behind it?
 What was it all about?
 So now they're going to have a clue, right?
 And so for me, and then, of course, all the Islamophobia that followed post 9/11.
 About to say, my position as first minister, even perhaps before then, did is definitely still a deep-rooted systemic and endemic Islamophobia in this country.
 And Scotland is absolutely not a mean to that.
 What is really disappointing about this is that there's really no way around the fact that Rory is painting me as a bigot here.
 Or at least somebody whose politics and ethics are compromised by a lack of understanding about what's really going on in the Muslim world.
 I don't think I'm being especially thin-skinned to perceive this as defamatory in some sense.
 One of the reasons why I bring this up is that I looked on Reddit where this got surfaced, and many people are now speculating that our conversation must have gone on
 for much longer than is indicated by the audio that I aired.
 I must have been badgering him for quite some time and then presented an abbreviated version of our conversation.
 That's not what happened at all.
 So you listen to our conversation, you are hearing every word we spoke to one another with the exception of possibly some sidebar conversation about setting up our microphones or something that would cut from every interview.
 Anyway, I've since reached out to Rory and he was quite gracious and I think embarrassed.
 He's great to come back on the podcast and do a post mortem on this.
 I'm pretty sure I know what happened here and I'm reasonably confident we can have a conversation that will be useful and who knows, maybe even fun.
 So you can look for that in the coming weeks.
 As for other misunderstandings and misrepresentations that seem very unlikely to be rectified through conversation, someone pointed out another one of those to me this week.
 Apparently, my former friend Elon Musk is bashing me again on the social media platform that he owns, X, and on the basis of yet another clip of a podcast appearance of mine that has been produced by yet another right-wing troll.
 This is what seems to happen every time now I go on someone else's podcast, people look for clips that can be exported from that appearance that are misleading as to what I believe and what I was saying in context.
 Sometimes, as in this case, it's pretty clear the clip isn't even saying what they claim it is, but they have titled their post something profoundly misleading.
 In any case, there was a clip from my appearance on the David Pakman show where I seemed to be talking about the crisis at the southern border of the US and worrying that someone like Tucker Carlson could exaggerate the gravity of the problem and thereby undermine Biden's chances of being reelected.
 And the whole thing got framed as me being skeptical that there was even a problem at the southern border.
 Of course, the chaos there is now a major concern of everyone right of center and many of us left of center.
 So Elon's response to this clip in front of millions of people was that Sam Harris's mind has turned to goo.
 Now, the irony here is that I think Elon and I have exactly the same view of the southern border.
 I view it as a political and social emergency and a scandal, and I have long been concerned that this is the issue that will deliver us a second Trump.
 So I am not at all inclined to minimize the significance of the problem there.
 However, in this case, I'm actually grateful for this instance of misrepresentation because it has finally convinced me that I can no longer care about this sort of thing.
 And I have so clear that social media has become a hallucination machine.
 There's no way to prevent this.
 No one has taken the time to find out what was really said in context.
 This is nothing to respond to here.
 So I suppose this is an epiphany I could have had and perhaps should have had many years ago because I've been complaining for 20 years about people misrepresenting my views.
 Even before the advent of social media.
 It's a thing that has driven me most crazy, really.
 But in this case, the misrepresentation is so ridiculous because again, Elon and I actually agree about what's happening at the southern border.
 That something has snapped for me and I just simply can't care about this anymore.
 It's quite a relief.
 So my pledge to you and to myself is that I'm not going to complain about this anymore.
 I'm not going to notice this sort of thing anymore.
 And the truth is I think this epiphany should extend to what has happened with Rory as well.
 The reason for me to do a podcast with Rory about this is I think his confusion here is so well-subscribed.
 And he is or should be so knowledgeable about the terrain here.
 This is somebody who knows much more about the Muslim world in many respects than I do.
 There's no question about that.
 So I just didn't want to leave it untouched because if there's any possibility of someone revealing my ignorance about anything relevant here, surely it's somebody like Rory who could do that.
 And given how much I have focused on Islam in the past and given how culpable I feel it is for so many of the world's problems, it would seem irresponsible for me not to revisit this topic with Rory.
 But in general, I think even there, I should forget about misrepresentations and misunderstandings.
 We are now just careening into a world of deep fakes and the most malignant distortions of everyone's public persona.
 So now I think I should just reconcile myself to the idea that anyone who cares about what I think will listen to what I say in one of my own channels at some appropriate length.
 And beyond that, there's nothing I can do.
 In fact, another example just crossed my desk.
 And this proves that there's basically nothing I can do to successfully take other people's feet out of my mouth.
 I saw a clip of Konstantin Kissen and Tom Billio in conversation on Tom's podcast about me.
 And they were talking about my cancellation effectively on the right and my views about Trump and COVID.
 And the amazing thing is I've been on both of their podcasts largely for the purpose of clarifying my views about Trump and COVID.
 And both of them are totally confused about what I think on both of those topics.
 I mean, these are both very smart guys who are clearly well disposed toward me.
 I like them and they like me and they're still completely confused about what I think on these two topics.
 And I have spent hours on each of their podcasts clarifying what I think it is fucking hopeless.
 I'm embarrassed that it has taken me this long to realize it, but this is now my new religion.
 I simply cannot care what other people think I think.
 I just have to put my stuff out there and move on.
 And that's what I will be doing on this podcast.
 Okay. And now for today's podcast.
 Today I'm speaking with Coleman Hughes.
 Coleman is a writer and podcast host and musician.
 He's written for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Quilett, The Spectator, City Journal, and elsewhere.
 He's currently a contributing writer at the Free Press and an analyst for CNN.
 He also has a sub-stack newsletter titled Coleman's Corner and a podcast, Conversations with Coleman.
 And most relevantly a new book, The End of Race Politics, Arguments for a Colorblind America.
 And that is the topic of today's conversation.
 We talk about race and racism.
 We discuss the ideal of colorblindness and what that means.
 Race and crime.
 Coleman's experience at TED, which you heard me discuss previously with Chris Anderson.
 The concept of Latinx.
 The confusion of the elites.
 Abraham X. Kendi.
 The death of George Floyd and the trial of Derek Chauvin.
 Candice Owens.
 Christopher Rufo.
 Guilt by association.
 John McWhorter.
 Glenn Lowry.
 Reparations for slavery and Jim Crow.
 The difference between various immigrant communities.
 Evidence of discrimination.
 The legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and other topics.
 As always, it was great to speak with Coleman.
 And now I bring you, Coleman Hughes.
 I am here with Coleman Hughes.
 Coleman, thanks for joining me again.
 Great to be on again.
 So you have a new book, The End of Race Politics, Arguments for a Colorblind America.
 And I must sheepishly confess that I have not read your book, though I appear to have blurbed
 it just for the record here.
 I had to declare Blurb bankruptcy some years ago.
 And so I don't blur books anymore.
 But occasionally I can blur the writer of that book, which is what I did in your case.
 But normally I would have read the book before we do a podcast, but I didn't get a physical
 copy.
 I blame no one for this but the universe.
 I know you sent me a PDF, but I spend so much time in front of screens.
 I just cannot read a book.
 That's a PDF.
 So the advantage to this is that there is a silver lining.
 We can really take it from the top and you can roll out your argument for a naive listener,
 which I will pretend to be, because you and I have talked about these issues before.
 And obviously we've thought a lot about them.
 But every listener to this podcast knows that I am a huge Coleman Hughes fan.
 I've made no secret of that.
 And I think in my Blurb for the book, I say something about, it's like you're a person
 from the future.
 You're the person who's come back from the future and born witness to what a sane future
 with respect to the variable of race actually looks like.
 And that's always how you've seemed to me.
 So let's just jump in.
 What is your basic argument in the book?
 Yeah.
 Well, first of all, thanks for breaking your rule on Blurbs for me.
 I'm honored.
 And in any event, a book is really just an occasion to talk about the topic in many ways.
 So yeah, my basic argument in this book is we have this idea of colorblindness with respect
 to race, which I define as treating people without regard to race, really making your
 best effort to treat the individuals in your lives without regard to their race when it
 matters.
 And to get race as a category out of public policy, to get rid of public policies that
 use race as a factor in determining how to distribute goods, services, aid, and so forth.
 And it's the second half of that is more controversial for people than the first half.
 And the reason this idea needs rescuing at all, because it was once the consensus view
 of American liberals, at least there was a brief moment in the 60s on the ringing rhetoric
 of Martin Luther King and the spirit of the civil rights movement, where enough people
 that mattered came together and agreed that colorblindness was the goal.
 And so many people agreed on it at that point that you even had a book like Black Power,
 which was the manifesto of the movement by the same name.
 In the late 60s, even acknowledged as a caveat that colorblindness was the ultimate goal worth
 pursuing and just disagreed on how we get there.
 In the intervening years, you've seen more and more people actually just abandon colorblindness
 even as an ultimate goal to the point where when I set out to do research for this book,
 just as a test, I googled colorblindness race so as to distinguish it from the visual
 condition.
 And nine out of 10 articles I got were articles telling me why colorblindness is wrong.
 It's in the worst case, a Trojan horse for white supremacy, or in the best case, naive.
 And the 10th article was a Wikipedia page.
 So something has happened in 50 years where the view that colorblindness is wrong and
 evil, which used to be confined to critical race theory, has become sort of the norm on
 the left.
 And to be fair, I think proponents of the idea of colorblindness have made themselves an
 easy target with the phrase, quote, I don't see color, which is really a common refrain
 and a common point of mockery among the critics of colorblindness, because it's obviously
 not true.
 We do see color.
 We all see color.
 And at a deeper level, we at least adults, we all see color.
 I think, you know, there are actually kids or people from other cultures can be something
 close to colorblind in the ways that matter.
 But most American adults are not colorblind.
 When I walk into a room, you notice that I'm not white.
 When you say I'm walking to a room, people notice that you are.
 What's more, we are all probably capable of racial bias.
 Clever psychologists can put us in experiments and, you know, show us in some cases to be
 racially biased.
 And in situations where race strongly correlates with something that matters, I think almost
 all of us are capable of racial bias.
 So that's not what I mean when I say colorblindness.
 And I don't think it's what people should mean when they say colorblindness.
 So I think we should abandon this misleading phrase that's too easy of a target.
 We don't see color.
 And instead say what we mean, which is I try my best to treat people without regard to
 race in my personal life.
 And I think race should be left out of public policy.
 That's the basic thesis of the book.
 Yeah, well, maybe we can cycle on that last point again, because I think it's interesting
 psychologically and ethically.
 Because I'm definitely guilty of saying something close to I don't see color or that I aspire
 to not see color or something like that, or I think we shouldn't see color.
 But it's not a matter of seeing so much as it is caring about, right?
 It's like the analogy I keep using to the consternation of many of my progressive critics
 is to hair color or to eye color.
 And of course, I see hair color and I see eye color, but they're not politically or ethically
 salient really ever, right?
 So I just simply don't care how many blondes did or didn't get into Harvard this year.
 And I don't think we as a society should care.
 And the only reason why we would care is if we had a history of discrimination against
 blonde people and we were tracking that because it was some historical injustice that we felt
 we need to rectify.
 And of course, that is the case with skin color.
 But when I imagine a truly sane future, which again, you appear to inhabit for me, I imagine
 a future where skin color has become like hair color or eye color, which is to say that
 it's an obvious surface feature around which people differ, but those differences simply
 don't matter.
 Even if we celebrate them, they don't matter.
 I mean, there are people who have especially beautiful hair or eyes and the color is part
 of that.
 And we might even talk about how amazing their hair and eyes look.
 And you can say the same thing for a person's skin, right?
 I mean, there are people who have just astonishing skin, you know, black or white or other.
 And it could be the actual topic of conversation, but it has no political or ethical weight.
 And it would be insane to think that it should.
 And so that's the colorblindness.
 I would advocate is something around that by analogy to hair color and eye color.
 Is there anything about that that strikes you as wrong?
 So you gave a caveat that, you know, unless we had a history of discrimination against
 a particular group of people, I think that I have the same caveat in my book and we can
 talk about sort of what my vision for for addressing that looks like.
 So I would echo that caveat and I would add one more, you know, unlike the case in eye
 color or hair color, there are cultural differences that track racial groups.
 We live in a multicultural society, multicultural country, which if anything means that there
 are multiple cultures.
 So I would consider black Americans, for example, to be a subculture of Americans, which are
 a broader culture.
 And in my effort and desire to be colorblind, right, to support colorblindness, both at
 the level of public policy and in my personal life, I don't think that that requires me
 to be culture blind in the sense that say you are a black person that's grown up your
 whole life, very attached to black culture.
 You love the food that black people cook, you love the movies that black people make,
 you love the music that comes culturally from black Americans and you have a special
 attachment to it that you don't quite have to every other culture that you don't have
 to say, you know, Serbian culture.
 Am I telling you that you can't feel that attachment or that you can't even preferentially consume
 and be among the culture that is familiar to you?
 Absolutely not.
 And that's not what I mean by colorblindness.
 What I picture is kind of a firewall between that kind of cultural affinity and our conversations
 about public policy and ethics and right and wrong.
 And we're talking about right and wrong, improving human flourishing, crafting public policy.
 One leaves those things to the extent you can at the door.
 And I say that because it's a common objection to the colorblindness argument.
 Yeah, I would echo that.
 I mean, I have a special attachment to Indian culture, for instance.
 I'm a huge fan of it notwithstanding all the insanity that one can find in India.
 It's my favorite food.
 It's among my favorite music.
 It's just I've spent a fair amount of time there.
 I love so much about it.
 And I would never assume anyone, much less Indians, should give that up, right?
 So it's that part of the diversity assertion that diversity makes everything better is
 I fully agree with.
 I want great Indian restaurants in every city in America.
 And I rely on Indian immigrants to provide those restaurants for the most part.
 And so it is with so much else, we all love to one or another degree about cultural difference.
 So yeah, so colorblindness of the sort that we're indicating by shorthand with that phrase
 can fully embrace a kind of xenophile relationship to cultural diversity.
 But it's a little bit like where this tips over into identity politics, I think can be
 understood by analogy to what it is to be a sports fan.
 There are a lot of people who really love sports.
 They become huge fans of one team or one athlete or another.
 And all of that is incredibly fun and amusing and improves life until it tips over into
 a kind of fanaticism that is really toxic.
 So toxic that you have soccer players who in the worst case commit an own goal and a
 big match and they wind up getting murdered by their fans back in Latin America or somewhere
 that really cares too much about that particular sport.
 It's hard to specify with a bright line, but there is clearly a line between the fun of
 diversity and the still caring about difference that adds spice to life and tipping over into
 political factionalism that is obviously distorting our politics and making it morally
 unworkable.
 So I don't know if you like that analogy or not, but that's another shortcut I have in
 thinking about this issue.
 No, actually, in my book, I talk a little bit about sports too.
 There is a difference between two close friends making, even making racial jokes about one
 another that both find funny, but neither take seriously.
 And on the other hand, two people coming to blows in a conversation because people of
 your race could never understand me.
 Those are both instances of quote unquote caring about race in the abstract, but we know
 the difference between them when we see them.
 One is actually a healthy expression, a kind of release valve for the racial differences
 we all notice.
 And one, as your analogy says, it carries what can be benign to an unhealthy extreme.
 Now my book, I talk about a similar racial analogy.
 When I bring up this video that Morgan Freeman famously participated in with Mike Wallace,
 I'm sure that you've seen it.
 I'm sure many people have seen it where Morgan Freeman essentially says, look, this is how
 we're going to get past race.
 I'm going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me
 a black man.
 I'm going to call you Mike and you're going to call me Morgan.
 And it's a very powerful interview if you haven't seen it.
 But what it puts forth is kind of a testable hypothesis in a way.
 If we want fewer and fewer racist thoughts and feelings and toxic race-based thoughts
 and feelings to abound in our society, should we talk about race more and more or should
 we talk about race less and less?
 And by analogy, I imagine that, say for whatever reason, we have a goal of reducing the amount
 of animosity between New York Yankee fans and Boston Red Sox fans, which is a very tall
 task.
 Let's say for whatever reason, we want to accomplish this.
 Would the thing to do be to raise people from age zero to care about baseball as much as
 possible?
 Right?
 Let's say we educate every child about the rules of baseball in kindergarten.
 We substitute every exercise in gym that used to be, say, dodgeball or kickball.
 And we make it baseball every time.
 And we just crank up to 12 the amount that people know about and care about baseball.
 Would this have the effect of amplifying the amount of animosity between New York fans
 and Boston fans or would it tamp down on it because everyone is so educated about baseball?
 It's at least not obvious to me, is what I'm saying.
 It's not obvious to me that the way towards better race relations between races of people
 is to raise the salience of racial identity from as young and age as young and age as
 possible.
 And this has been the implicit and at times explicit belief of progressive race ideas.
 I'm thinking of Robin DiAngelo, her book, ""White Fragility.""
 I'm thinking of just this past week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that a school
 in San Francisco has been paying an organization called Woke Kindergarten to come into a school
 of mostly Spanish-speaking kids and teach them about white supremacy as their math and
 reading scores have declined.
 So it's not obvious to me that Morgan Freeman is wrong in that we should dial down our somewhat
 obsessive talk about racial identity and sort of confine it to the real racism.
 I have no problem and I'm strongly in favor of talking about real racism that exists.
 I give examples in my book, but I think a lot of what we end up talking about when we talk
 about race are either fake examples of racism or just kind of toxic race-based discussion
 that sort of stereotypes whole groups of people and does not deal with actual examples of racism.
 Yeah, I want to get into some of those issues and the difference between race and class
 and how we should think about dealing with inequality in our society, even inequality
 that is highly correlated with race still.
 What about those cases just to close the loop on colorblindness as a goal?
 What about the inconvenient cases where one's awareness of racial difference is made all
 too rational because of different base rate effects with respect to crime and other variables.
 There are definitely situations where a person's race is a relevant piece of information in
 judging whether or not something anomalous and potentially dangerous is likely to happen.
 This is a, it lands one way when you have a white guy like me saying that it landed
 differently when Jesse Jackson, I don't know when this was, might have been in the '90s,
 somewhere around the peak of crime in America, he said, you know what I forget what context
 he was in, but he said to some audience, I'll tell you what I'm sick of.
 I'm sick of walking down the street at night, hearing footsteps behind me, turning and seeing
 that it's a white guy and feeling relief, right?
 That was an all too honest confession of a fairly horrific disparity in the rate of
 crime in the black versus white community.
 In case people are not in touch with these statistics, this is still true, although in
 the '90s this was worse, and most of this crime is, you know, most crime is intra-racial,
 and most black people are victimized by other black people, most white people are victimized
 by other white people.
 There's some differences there that are worth talking about, but still, it's mostly a matter
 of, I mean, crime in the black community is mostly black on black crime, and it certainly
 was then.
 What do you do with the inconvenient fact that it is in fact true that in certain situations
 just you see black people in a place where you know there are not that many black people
 living and you know that most crime, now I'm not talking about violent crime so much
 as the other crime, you know that most crime is in fact committed by black people in that
 part of the city.
 It suddenly becomes relevant that you're seeing four black guys in a car driving on
 a street they almost certainly don't live on, and this is true in many major cities in
 America, and it's relevant for the police eye view of that situation, right, and this is
 profiling by another name.
 And conversely, it would be relevant to see, you know, four white guys with shaved heads
 in a parking lot outside of black church, right, like you would immediately wonder what
 are those guys doing here, and you wouldn't be insane to wonder that given the pattern
 of criminality we know exists in certain contexts.
 So I just I give you that none too softball to deal with.
 Yes.
 So take my feet out of my mouth.
 Okay.
 So look, I've lived in New York City for nine years now, and I've lived in many different
 neighborhoods, some less nice than others, I check the NYPD statistics as a matter of
 professional responsibility and someone who thinks and talks about these issues.
 And I also take I ride the subway.
 I have eyes.
 Like I said, a commitment to colorblindness doesn't mean that I don't see race.
 It doesn't mean I don't notice patterns.
 And when when there are patterns as strong as some of the racial crime patterns are in
 many American cities, it is inevitable that your brain is going to recognize those patterns,
 whether or not you want it to.
 Now some people are more or less honest about this.
 I think you've chosen the path of being honest about this in line with your overall position
 on lying.
 Other people choose the path of denying the facts, which is understandable given how uncomfortable
 the facts are.
 And then a third group of people takes the route of focusing mono maniacally on those
 facts and posting nothing but videos of black people committing crime on Twitter.
 That latter path I think is toxic and needlessly divisive.
 The path of simply not talking about it.
 While it might be right at Thanksgiving dinner, I don't think that it's right as a general
 orientation for our public conversation about race.
 I think that journalists have to be able to look at facts.
 So in New York City, basically the entire time that I've lived here, it has been the
 case that over 90% of shootings are committed by blacks and Hispanics.
 95% in some years.
 So what is it like to be a New York City cop that responds to these shootings?
 By the way, the majority of such cops are themselves of color.
 What that experience is like is if it isn't clear from the first month of your being a
 New York City cop, it is clear by the first three or four months that every almost every
 time you get a call about a shooting, a 911 call, you'll make money all day betting that
 the person was not white or not Asian.
 That is an impossible fact not to notice even for someone as committed to the end goal of
 colorblindness as one could possibly be.
 Now I don't view that as refuting the goal of colorblindness in general.
 I view that as having two implications.
 One is it shows you how wrong things have to go for the general rule of thumb of color
 blindness to be violated.
 You really have to be in situations where violence and life and death and catching felons
 where the stakes are that high as opposed to say meeting a friend of a friend for the first
 time in a coffee shop, which is how most of us listening this are lucky enough to live
 most of our lives in lower stakes situations where there's no need to violate the principle
 of colorblindness.
 And then secondly, it impresses upon me the urgency of actually addressing crime and getting
 crime under control of not letting crime spike.
 I can tell you every single black person I know that lived in New York City in the 80s
 or 90s says that as a black man in that time, you couldn't you couldn't catch a cab.
 But nowadays it's gotten better.
 The other thing everyone who's lived in New York City says is that crime was terrible
 in the 90s.
 Everyone got mugged and carried muggers money around.
 And then Giuliani came and it just all went away.
 My strong suspicion is that those two things are not correlated.
 In other words, if we care about reducing racism against black people, there is almost
 no better way to do that than to actually address crime.
 Because when crime comes down, the proverbial cab driver and cop and so forth who are in
 those high-stakes situations where they can't help but discriminate, there will be less
 of an urge for them to do that.
 So the hard example here just impresses upon me not the fact that colorblindness should
 be jettisoned, but the fact that A, we should really get pay attention to crime as a component
 of fighting racism and impresses upon me how high the stakes have to be in order for us
 to jettison it in the first place.
 Well, finally, on the topic of colorblindness, I know you on your own podcast and elsewhere
 have done a fairly full post-mortem on your experience at TED where you gave a talk on
 the topic of colorblindness and received a fair amount of pushback and I think you probably
 heard my conversation with Chris Anderson about that.
 So I don't know how much you want to be debriefed on your experience here and we can touch
 it as fully or as superficially as you want but I didn't go so deep with Chris apart from
 just exposing what seemed to me to be the core of the issue which he more or less admitted
 which he said it was a fairly amazing disclosure and he didn't seem to treat it with the astonishment
 that I think it deserves which is that when he admitted that you could never have been
 invited to TED just a few short years ago, which is tantamount to saying that Martin
 Luther King Jr. could not have given a TED talk a few years ago given the level of ideological
 capture of the organization or along the lines of that we're talking about, feel free to
 say anything you want about your experience or my conversation with Chris but you were
 talking to a very high status audience about the virtues of maintaining colorblindness as
 the goal of our racial politics and it provoked a fairly hysterical response which was I really
 in my view pathological on its face, not really the, it doesn't testify to a mere difference
 of opinion on these issues, it testifies to a kind of brokenness of certain people and
 certain cultural attitude which is, you know, I think I told Chris, I mean you gave one
 of the most anodyne talks imaginable, not anodyne as in boring but just anodyne as in non-threatening
 given its, you know, your thesis and yet people perceived it to have really precipitated a
 kind of moral emergency, you know, in the room when you gave it so that's...
 Yeah, yeah, so if people want the detailed version they can read my account of it at
 the free press, I'll just make a few comments. One, yeah, I agree with you, it was anodyne
 and it was non-threatening and I was non-threatening and I was friendly to people the whole week
 and I was, I actually literally, you know, had a conversation and hugged it out with
 one of the people that was upset with the TED Talk afterward because I just, for whatever
 reason I... I have a lot of patience for people that are emotionally upset by what I say and
 so I was willing to go every extra mile to get people to understand that I wasn't quote
 unquote attacking their existence but there were some people at TED, a very small minority
 it should be said, that have the philosophy of safetyism wherein what I was saying wasn't
 just something they strongly disagreed with, it made them feel quote unquote unsafe and
 once something makes you feel unsafe then, you know, then I have to be removed essentially,
 right? It's a very powerful bargaining tactic if you're an employee because then there's
 like implications for hostile workplace environment and things like that when really all I did
 was, you know, gently give my perspective that, you know, 98% of the people in the room went
 down pretty smooth with them, people of all colors by the way, you know, people were coming
 up to me afterwards not just white people as the stereotype might, you might think, but
 black people, Hispanic people, and so forth.
 But just to remind people of the context here, it is pretty amazing for Chris to have told
 me that you could not have been invited a couple of years prior. You know, his perception
 of the organization and perhaps his misperception of his audience suggested to him that you
 were an edgy speaker and really all you were arguing for was, you know, as you said at the
 top here, what was the consensus, the moral consensus view during the civil rights movement?
 Yes, that's true. I mean, right down to Martin Luther King's recommendation in his book Why
 We Can't Wait for a broad class-based anti-poverty program that would benefit the black and
 white poor alike. So I was really just giving a pretty straightforward Martin Luther King
 updated for the 21st century. It was nothing new, nothing original, just something I feel
 passionate about and I think people I've forgotten. And when I agree with him, I actually take
 it for granted as almost obvious that I couldn't have given that talk two years ago, for instance,
 because the so-called racial reckoning around the summer of 2020 and its aftermath was still
 reverberating too strongly through elite institutions. I would have been received as
 just, you know, even further outside the realm of acceptable opinion. But, you know, I think
 this underscores the huge difference between the elite and the non-elite in general. I
 think most non-elites that listen to that Ted talk, I appreciate you saying it's not boring,
 but I think many would have found it boring because it's common sense. It's common sense,
 that's right. And it's only not common sense to the kinds of people that think Latinx is
 what Hispanic people want to be called. And I use that example, I should flesh it out
 a little bit more, because it encapsulates the divide between the elite and the non-elite
 better than any other single issue, I think. I'm half Puerto Rican and grew up spending
 a lot of time with the Puerto Rican half of my family, many of whom didn't speak English
 in the older generation. And so, when around 2014 and 2015, I got to college and people,
 I started seeing this term Latinx. It was very bizarre because I'd never heard it before,
 and I figured having grown up constantly around my Puerto Rican family members, I'd have heard
 of it if it were in use. And then secondly, it just seemed like a bizarre anglicization
 because Spanish doesn't actually operate in a way that makes a word like Latinx even
 makes sense, theoretically. So, when people started using it at Columbia, most of whom
 had no Hispanic family, this struck me as very odd, intuitively, because in that particular
 case, I was fairly in touch with how a working class Hispanic person would speak. Now, when
 Pew finally did research on this and found that some 96%, 95% or 6% in if memory serves
 of Hispanic people either had never heard of the word or didn't like it, that struck
 me as intuitively obvious. Now, Latinx is an issue because I happen to have that background,
 I happen to have intuitions that were more in line with reality, but in most other ways,
 I could be as clueless and elite as anyone. I grew up upper middle class. I went from a
 very nice public school to a very nice private school to Juilliard and then Columbia University.
 I'm as elite virtually as anyone could be on most issues. And to sit back and reflect
 on how thick the bubble of eliteness can be, it's like you can pierce it 20 times and
 it can still have an effect in terms of just the difference between the norms and culture
 of elites and the norms and culture of everyone else. And the TED example, it's just another
 example of that. What I said is only controversial to a group of people who have really, I think,
 forgotten or don't work hard enough to understand how unique and elite their set of values are.
 Well, I mean, I should just say, if it wasn't obvious and certainly obvious in my conversation
 with Chris, but I should make it obvious here, I really greatly admire Chris. But I've always
 viewed him as a kind of canary in the coal mine for these kinds of issues. I mean, I think
 I told him, I viewed him as someone who was a bit of a hostage of his organization. Suffering
 from by turns Stockholm syndrome or some other condition where he can't quite recognize how
 aberrant the elites have become on certain issues. And I say this as someone who considers
 himself embedded very much in that same bubble with you and Chris and the very people who
 are reacting, who were reacting badly to your talk, I might run to this issue with Chris
 around issues of, you know, around radical Islam and the allegations of Islamophobia,
 et cetera. And so we've gone around that track a bunch. And I just think we have to be honest
 about what's really happening in the world and honest about how clear the ethical and
 political goals are or should be. And I think here's a landmark we really shouldn't lose
 sight of and yet certain people are working to guide us in a very different direction.
 I mean, the landmark is as MLK had it and as you have dusted it off, getting to a world
 where superficial differences simply don't matter and we care about the content of a
 person's character, not the color of their skin to use MLK's line. That just seems so
 obviously good. And yet, many people are arguing that explicitly arguing that that's
 a false goal. It's not just that there's a different way to reach that goal. I do take
 it as prima facie absurd to think that we're going to care more and more about race as
 a way of caring less and less about it as you pointed out. But we have a few characters
 who are quite celebrated in elitist circles at places like Ted or at the Aspen Ideas Festival.
 And I think none has been as damaging to the conversation from my point of view as
 Ibermex Kendi. I know you have offered to debate him. Has he ever responded to those
 offers to debate? No, he hasn't. He said in a few of his lectures that I've misrepresented
 his views. And that's so a debate between us would him would be him constantly sort
 of correcting my straw man. But to my knowledge, he's never given an example of me misrepresenting
 his views. And I would hope a debate would be a great forum for him to make clear what
 my misrepresent misrepresentation alleged. But I think I just want to pick up a little
 bit on what you said about Chris too. And I want to make that clear too because I like
 Chris. I continue to like Chris. I think he is in a tough position. It seems maybe straddling
 between values he seems to share with me and the reality of his employees' feelings.
 Not sure how I would navigate that. And I'm not in charge of a big organization like
 that. Frankly, I think that my Ted debacle unleashed a wave of repressed anger at Ted
 among people that used to love Ted, but for one or another reason, because of some aspect
 of woke capture, either don't go to Ted anymore or just don't like it anymore. And I think
 my debacle became like released pent up anger of years. And I think that was quite unpleasant.
 But it can also be an opportunity for him to course correct. And I know he's invited
 Barry Weiss and Bill Ackman and other people that might upset the same kinds of people
 that were upset with me. I think a bunch of Ted fellows have resigned because of those
 invitations, which might be a good thing. But it's again, it's worth reiterating literally
 like high 90 percentile of the audience appeared to be totally fine. Whether or not they agreed
 with everything I said, they were not triggered. Like Ted's audience is actually way more open
 to I think all of these ideas than they might be stereotyped by people unfamiliar. It's
 really the hecklers veto. It's a very small percentage of people that punch above their
 weight and ought to be ignored.
 So where does DEI come into this? I'm not sure anyone listening to this podcast thinks
 the ideological capture of our institutions has been exaggerated anymore. I mean, we're
 now having this conversation in the aftermath of those disastrous hearings before Congress
 where you had the presidents of Harvard and MIT and Penn unable to spell out what was wrong
 with advocating for genocide against the Jews while having just, you know, merely weeks and
 months prior, defenestrated people for not admiring DEI policies or admitting that there
 are only two biological sexes, et cetera. So we know that there's a fair amount of moral
 confusion in our universities and that DEI has something to do with it. But it was up
 until that moment, it was still very common to hear that all this concern about wokism
 or identitarian moral confusion or DEI overreach, all of this just, it's just pure Republican
 hyperbole, right? It's just not a problem. It's just it's exaggerated. And it's I'm not
 detecting that anymore. So I mean, perhaps you have a better sense of if there any shades
 of skepticism on that point still remaining. What's your sense of what DEI has done and
 do you think the pendulum is in the process of swinging back across all of our institutions
 of now thinking of major corporations and universities and media properties? And where
 do you think it should swing back to?
 Yeah. So the original idea and the benign idea of diversity, equity and inclusion, the
 idea that say someone like my dad, a black man in corporate America would have meant
 by DEI in the 90s is like, say you're a boss of a company in the past.

Sam Harris, who's a neuroscientist, philosopher,
 New York Times bestselling author, host of the Making Sense podcast and also creator of the waking
 up course. Sam, I don't know exactly when you were last on. I think it's been a year and a half,
 quite frankly, and at least, and, and so many things have happened since then, including things
 you've been waiting on. Yes, it's been quite a beautiful, it's amazing. Just to start somewhere,
 I've mentioned to my audience before, when they ask me about confronting this person or that person
 about X or Y issue, you're sort of small fires framework that you've used on your program about
 the complexities of even if we have actors who be they bad faith or deliberately dishonest or
 uninformed, the ease with which one can confront them with the facts in the overarching 30,000 foot
 perspective and they can very easily set a number of small fires by bringing up the Singapore study
 that maybe exists. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe you've heard of it. Maybe you haven't or what about that
 thing from Peru that happened or this sort of thing. And if I understand correctly, this is part
 of the framework for which you have been disinclined to engage in some of those arguably worthy
 discussions on a number of different issues. Is this still your perspective? Is there more you
 can add to it? How do you see the discourse with those types of debates right now?
 Well, I think we have a responsibility to to make any audience alert to this problem, right?
 This is a kind of a problem of asymmetric information warfare where it's just it's much easier
 to make a mess than it is to clean it up, right? And this is just this is just a principle of
 any debate and you know what they're formal or otherwise and and audiences don't tend to
 they certainly go to even if they're aware of it, they go to sleep to it, right? Because it's just
 in each case, you're it's a bit of a conjuring trick, right? It's like see like if you go to a
 magic show, you know, it's not actual magic, right? You know, it's it's it's based on misdirection
 and at some point, the guy puts the rabbit in the hat, right? And you're not meant to see that.
 But the illusion works more or less all the time unless you're presumably unless you're a
 professional magician and you really get you can spot the trick. There's there's something
 analogous to that in many debates on, you know, topics of, of, you know, great interest and you
 know, polarization. And so you're you're alluding to, you know, some of the COVID debates or the
 vaccine debates that I'm not inclined to have. Yeah, it's it's but the other problem is that
 it's it's rarely a matter of total falsehood or conscious lying on the part of the person
 you're talking to them that there are there are half truths or, you know, truths, you know, amplified
 in the wrong way or in the wrong context that are genuinely misleading. And that there's something
 more pernicious about the kernel of truth that is doing some, you know, mad work in an otherwise
 spurious argument. So, you know, like the it is in fact true that vaccine injury is a thing, right?
 There's some people who have terrible responses to vaccines, you know, not just COVID vaccines,
 any vaccine, however, well tested and and wise to take and as a general matter, there are people
 who just just can't take vaccines for a variety of reasons and discover that sometimes by having
 gotten a vaccine and had a terrible response to it. So, if you if you focus on the if you if you
 try to deny the reality of vaccine injury, many people know that that can't possibly be true because
 they know someone who knows someone who had some terrible response, right? So, and yet it's it's
 very easy to use the reality of vaccine injury in any conversation about COVID vaccines or any
 vaccine, you know, the way someone like RFK Jr. would to to stoke fear that is in the aggregate
 quite irrational. If debates of the sort that you're opting not to do
 aren't an effective way of disabusing people of some of these notions,
 what are the what is the framework or what are the tools that can be used if we agreed that we
 would be better off as a society if fewer people believed some of this stuff?
 Well, I'm not saying categorically that debates are never the right thing. And I so for instance,
 I wouldn't say that absolutely no one should debate a person like RFK Jr. I just don't think
 I'm the person to do it. And I think the format would really have to be
 thought out well in advance. And it's because it does require again, because it's so asymmetric,
 because someone can just hit you with a blizzard of of detail, which is, you know, in its, you know,
 main points, you know, a proper conspiracy theory or, or, you know, fairly delusional and yet will
 contain lots of misleading facts. You just have to you need a you need to sort of fact check all
 that in advance, right? I mean, if you're going to just have 90 minutes of audio or video to showcase
 this conversation, you need to have agreed upon the let's say the sources that would be cited
 in advance, right? So you need to have kind of pre-bunked those sources. You need to know what's
 wrong with the study that RFK Jr referenced last time, right? And then you need to do do all that
 work. And for me, it's just it's not, you know, I'm not an epidemiologist or a virologist or an
 immunologist. I mean, I'm not a relevant specialist in any of those areas. And I think it would take
 someone whose full time job is to chase down all of those, you know, bad references to do that
 adequately. And that said, I think there are some people who you probably shouldn't quote platform
 because to platform platform them is to dignify their side of the argument with with much more
 credence than it should be, right? So the reason why I, you know, wouldn't tend to debate creationists
 in a, you know, in a in a Christian context, right? Like I've done that before, but you know, a little
 of that goes a very long way. And to give people the idea that really debating the veracity of
 evolution at this point is a good use of time is even of itself misleading about the nature of
 what we know about the universe. So I just I think you have to pick your battles here. And
 I think it's it entails much more than just flipping on the microphones on a popular podcast
 and letting things roll. I've been I've been trying to think about how to open this next door that
 I want to go through with you. And I'll do it without naming anyone. And we can continue without
 naming anyone. Or if you decide there are people you want to talk about, that's fine. But I won't
 name anyone. Generally, what I'm curious in getting your thoughts on is over the last several years,
 one could argue that there has been a breakdown of the so-called intellectual dark web. One
 could argue that there has been a role reversal of sorts in places where we may be used to be able
 to find sanity and rationality where we no longer can. And some of us that are on the left, but not
 blindly accepting everything that comes out of the left have to find new enclaves or places to look
 for that sanity or reason. How would you characterize the change that we've seen in the
 landscape that you inhabit over the last several years? And do you think that this is
 part of some bigger shift in the public discourse?
 Well, I think I should just acknowledge the kernels of truth that are there that are that are actually
 deranging that many of the people we're not now naming. And the kernel of truth, which is just
 in plain view for everyone to see, is that something has happened in the last, let's call it 10 years,
 but most noticeably in the last six or so, to the left politically, mostly not only in the
 United States, but certainly most salient in the United States. And the most recent
 symptom of this were those congressional hearings with the college presidents who
 couldn't figure out how to say that calling for genocide against the Jews was a violation of their
 terms of service, while we all know that even acknowledging that there are two sexes
 biologically was a violation just mere moments before that, or being uncertain about whether
 academics should sign DEI pledges as a requirement for their employment. That was also a
 cancelable offense at our universities. So the hypocrisy there was galling to many of us,
 and it's unsustainable. It's a symptom of moral confusion and ideological capture
 in our mainstream institutions. It goes by the name of political correctness in the before times,
 but now it's wokeness or a social justice hysteria or an identitarian moral panic,
 or I've referred to it in by many of those terms. There's a problem with all of this,
 and the question is what to do about it. Now, what many of these people in the IDW have
 thought to do about it is to focus on it to the exclusion of everything else, and to
 not acknowledge the monstrosity of Trumpism that it stands at their backs, that the populist
 lunacy on the right, that is certainly by some measures quite a bit more dangerous than anything
 we're seeing on the left. Now, I tend to keep both of these grotesque objects in view all of the time,
 and I'm by turns more or less concerned or more or less animated by one of them. So I have spent
 a lot of time focused on the problems of the left, and I've spent a lot of time focused on
 the problems of the right, that the real failure, the moral and political failure of many of these
 people who I used to consider friends and colleagues, and with whom I've fallen out to one or another
 degree, professionally and even socially, is that they, for whatever reason, have decided that they
 can't chew gum and walk at the same time. They can't acknowledge the obvious pathology of having a
 sitting president who won't commit to a peaceful transfer of power and who pretends that an election
 is being stolen from him, even while trying actually to steal the election. They can't acknowledge any
 of that because they're so concerned about the ideological capture that has occurred on the left.
 They're so concerned about the derangement of the New York Times and the 1619 Project,
 say, and how historical that was, or pick your example. And I just think that's a fallacy,
 and it's in itself dangerous and deranging of our public conversation.
 And I think in some of these cases, the reason for this meopia is really inscrutable. In others,
 it's probably, there's an obvious business model there. I mean, there's this phenomenon of audience
 capture where people begin to cater to a signal they detect in their audience. Viewers go up,
 the subscriptions go up, something goes up, and they say, ""Okay, my audience clearly wants more of that.""
 And they become radicalized by their own audience. They notice that their audience is filled with
 vaccine skeptics, or Trump loyalists, or people who just want to talk about the trans issue in
 sports all the time. And they begin to cater to that and pander to that. And then that is the
 very nature of what it is to sell out. And so there's some of that too. And I haven't
 diagnosed it in each case, but it's something that I can't really interact with now in a comfortable
 way because in certain cases, it's just starkly unethical. I've viewed several of these people
 as having lost their integrity, and that matters. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm
 curious if we would be able to sum up for the audience who may not listen to your podcast,
 how you might relate the relative significance of these different elements. I'll give my view,
 maybe, and then you tell me where you are relative to that. I see the motivations for
 DEI, what is called wokeness and social justice as worthy motivations, which have been taken to
 extremes that have perverted these movements. And I don't lose sight of the fact that there is
 also this gargantuan monster next to it, which is that the modern Republican party would be
 glad to destroy and end democracy altogether. And I want to keep that relationship in mind
 as I choose to what degree do I talk about these different issues? Where are you relative to that?
 Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree with that. The one piece I would add, which accounts for why I have
 spoken about the pathology on the left so much is that there really is an asymmetry with respect to
 the cultural capture of this ideology. So I mean, Trumpism is incredibly dangerous. It is the
 first time in my lifetime, I really worried about the fate of American democracy. It really seems
 like it's possible. It's conceivable that we could lose it under the shadow of this thing.
 So it's a huge problem. But it is, in some strange way, still a fringe problem culturally, or at least
 culturally with respect to the institutions I care about. So when you look at the high status
 institutions in our society, the best universities, the best media properties, the Fortune 500 companies,
 what is it that people in Silicon Valley or in Hollywood, the people who make culture for the
 most part, what do they believe? It's not Trumpism. It's not that the election was stolen. It's not
 that QAnon might be right about something. It's for the most part, this far left,
 again, I would agree with you, at bottom, well-intentioned, or originally well-intentioned,
 overreaction, and I would call it a moral panic around issues of inequality, racial inequality in
 particular. But it's gender. It's sexuality. It's in some cases religious. The way in which
 we have seen this explosion of antisemitism correlate very strangely with far left,
 disproportionately well-educated people and their beliefs about race. We've mapped on
 the racial experience of African-Americans over the last 70 years
 onto the world and wrapped up Islamist goons and theocrats into that same blanket of tolerance
 and concern. So the jihadists of the world are the African-Americans who we need to worry about
 locally, for all of our wealth inequality and the disparities of educational attainment and
 health security and everything else. These same people who are focused on that
 somehow see what's happening with Hamas as analogous to that. There's just a profound moral
 confusion about the global civilization that has occurred domestically in America, and it's
 actually been exported to much of the West. So this is also happening in London.
 So it's a mad tangle of, again, I would agree, in many cases, well-intentioned moral intuitions,
 but it's destabilizing and gaslighting and ultimately insane, specifically when you're
 talking about things like taking the side of Hamas in the current conflict in the Middle East.
 What do you make of the reaction from those on the left who say,
 it's not that we're taking the side of Hamas. It's that there is no consideration given to
 the 20, 30-year situation and circumstances in which Palestinians have lived and we have to separate
 Hamas from Palestinians and whatever Hamas did, whether I condemn it or not, it doesn't matter
 because Benjamin Netanyahu is going to press forward and do XYZ. That sort of package of
 responses, which is almost like it's a series of boxes that are checked off and when speaking
 to some of these folks, do you find that that reaction is based in a good faith concern for the
 perceived oppressed or do you think that that's based in something different altogether?
 Well, it's based on a confusion or a disinclination to look at the reality on the ground in
 not just in Gaza, but in Muslim societies, the world over. And the radical core
 of Islam that is producing so much of this conflict. I would call it jihadism in its most
 pernicious form. At bottom, it's something that doesn't have much to do or anything in principle
 to do with Israel. Israel is in a war against jihadists. Hamas is a jihadist organization
 and Hezbollah is a jihadist organization and Iran is effectively run by a jihadist
 government, whatever the actual sympathies of most Iranians at this moment, many of whom are
 certainly tired of living under theocrats. But the generic problem is jihadism. It's a specific
 ideology around religious conflict and holy war and martyrdom. And it is just much bigger
 than Israel and it's much bigger than American foreign policy. And this is something I've
 banged on about in fits and starts for the last 20 years ever since September 11th.
 And it's a problem that's not going away. It can seem to go away. We can certainly lose sight
 of it. They're bright, shiny objects that capture our attention and we forget about it,
 something like Trumpism. Trump takes up all of our oxygen and we don't notice the problem of
 jihadism until a dozen people get murdered in the streets of Paris, say, right? And
 to Shouse of Al-Hoo Akbar. But it's a problem that has not gone away. It will not go away until
 two billion Muslims decide that they can't support it in any form, right? And they have to
 anathematize it and really treat it like the pathology that it is. And one of the things to
 notice is that most victims of jihadism are Muslim, right? There's a continuous problem
 throughout the world in dozens of countries, many of which are in Africa, where you just have
 jihadists killing their co-religionists over sectarian reasons and again, murdering apostates
 and making life generally miserable for everybody. And we just don't pay attention to it. We don't
 think about it. I mean, you know, Boca Huram in Nigeria is using child soldiers as suicide bombers,
 right? Who cares, right? We just don't, we don't pay attention to it. It doesn't affect us. And yet
 just take five minutes to explore the details there. And it is an unimaginable type of violence,
 right? I mean, the suicide bombing itself should be unimaginable when you actually think of the
 details psychologically. But turning children into bombs, right? I mean, what planet are we on,
 right? And there's only one culture that does this, right? And it's the extreme variant of
 of fundamentalism to use a, a somewhat inappropriate term, you know, but an American one,
 within the context of traditional Islamic societies.
 There is, I don't know how much you weighed into this or want to, but there is a growing voice in,
 is it the Democratic Party? Is it the left? Is it whatever those two overlap that Joe Biden will
 be punished in November because of his kind of fill in the blanks, support for what Netanyahu is doing,
 providing a funding to Israel. Displeasure with Biden's role is the point, I think, that is being
 made. I, as someone who can understand why different folks might prefer less American involvement in
 the region, struggle to understand why one would stay home or vote for Trump in order to punish Joe
 Biden when it seems that the alternative is so much worse. In other words, I see that Trump has
 essentially taken the position of just kind of destroy Gaza. You know, who cares? I don't bet it.
 I struggle to, to really believe that there's a significant contingent of this left that is going
 to take an action in November, whether it's not voting or voting for Trump. I don't know why they
 would do that. That would actually make the very problem they've identified worse by their own
 evaluation. Do you have a sense of whether this slice of the left, as it currently stands,
 really might do that in November in an election?
 Well, I don't. I mean, I would share your astonishment if they thought Trump were better on this
 particular issue. If this is their hobby horse, right, if support for Israel is the thing they
 they want to erode, well, I mean, Trump, granted he is an isolationist, but you know, his support
 for Israel has been fairly reflexive. And, you know, despite a few hiccups he's had with Netanyahu,
 his, you know, he's been much less critical of Netanyahu than Biden has been, or than any
 Democrat has been. So yeah, I just, I wouldn't know what to expect of Trump in a second administration
 around Israel. I mean, I was, I would assume he would support it, but he, again, his isolationist
 noises are, are, you know, at cross purposes with that. I mean, I just, I view him as a moral
 lunatic who really thinks only of himself. So it's hard to predict exactly what he would do.
 But it's a, I mean, I'm much more worried, frankly, that Biden will suffer an erosion
 of support for the op, you know, for other reasons on that kind of the opposite side of the
 political continuum among independents and others who are worried about the southern border, for
 instance. I mean, you only need to see a few videos coming from the southern border. And if you,
 you know, arguably uncharitable framings of those videos by, by propagandists from the other side,
 I mean, as someone like Tucker Carlson, claiming that, like, look, look, this is Biden's policy.
 And then he'll show you people by the thousands coming into the, you know, coming across the border
 without any sign that, that, that we know what we know who they are, we can do anything about it.
 That I think a lot of people really care about and especially in the aftermath of October 7th,
 right? The idea that we have a border that we just can't police, that we're not inclined to
 police and we have no, and millions of people are coming to the country. We have no idea who
 they are, but we know at this point that they're not just Latin Americans looking for work.
 There are people from all over the world and coming to hear for who knows what purpose.
 You spin that up into a conspiracy theory or just a, just a un-constrained fear of, for the future.
 It's, that's the issue I think he has to get a handle on more than, than signaling that it's
 daylight between him and Netanyahu, where I think there, I mean, there should be daylight
 between him and Netanyahu, because I think Netanyahu is a, a fairly Trumpian, self-serving
 character at this point. I say he's, he is somebody who is at least in part culpable for the problem
 Israel finds itself in. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about artificial intelligence
 to some degree. I've done a few interviews on, on the issue, including with folks who believe,
 stop it completely right now, moratorium, how that's imposed. I don't know, they don't usually
 say all the way to the other side, which is, yes, we have to be careful, but this, we don't even
 fully understand yet the ways in which this is going to fill in the blanks about the way in which
 it's going to improve society for everybody, increase leisure time. I mean, it's a lot of the
 stuff we heard in 1900, which didn't happen, interestingly enough, that maybe now will thanks
 to AI. I'd love to hear a little bit from you about where your perspective is on this. You've
 done a number of episodes about it, and I'm curious where you're landing right now on AI.
 Yeah, well, my, my views about it really haven't changed. I think we're, we've seen progress
 in it that has surprised more or less everyone. So I, we're, we're here sooner than, than I was
 expecting, frankly, I don't know what I was expecting. I mean, my, my argument for,
 are being concerned about AI really wasn't anchored to any kind of timeline. I think I gave my,
 I gave my TED talk on this topic in 2016, and I think it was about 2014 or 15, where I first
 became the cognizant of the issue and, and worried about it. I mean, I, I like it, more or less,
 everyone had thought we hadn't made much progress. Then all of a sudden progress,
 the rumors of progress were, you know, un-enorable with, with, you know, the breakthroughs that DeepMind
 made with chess and Go and AlphaFold and, and then, and then, yeah, I mean, this, this has been,
 it's been quite thrilling on one level. If you're at all hopeful that we can build this technology
 in a way that is safe, well, then it really does seem like we're, we're on the cusp of
 solving lots of problems for which more intelligence is the solution. So it could be the most useful
 labor-saving device ever invented. And then we just have to get our minds around what, you know,
 what we do politically and economically around that and the, and the displacement of human labor
 that would, would be quickly following that. But I do worry, and I think many people much closer to
 this, to this work are, are similarly worried that we're in a, a, a, a situation where the incentives
 are aligned so as to produce a, a catastrophic outcome if we make sufficiently quick progress,
 right? I mean, we're in an arms race condition. And an arms race is not the condition you want to
 be into to incentivize the, the cautious ethical deployment of a technology, which it seems,
 you sort of have to get right on the first try, right? I mean, we, we can't
 birth a, a digital God that is more intelligent and more competent than we are,
 that is unaligned with our interests. And then we have to find ourselves in the position of
 negotiating with that thing to become more aligned with our interests, right? I mean,
 the people who doubt that there's any real danger here, in my view, are people who are,
 who are not taking the time to imagine what it will be like to have a system that really is
 general in its intelligence and superhuman in its intelligence. It will be superhuman by definition
 because all of our narrow intelligences are already superhuman. I mean, the calculator in your phone
 is better than you are at arithmetic. It's, you know, the, the facial recognition and speech
 recognition and emotion recognition and all these, these, these piecemeal capacities were
 building into, to AI at this point. Once it, once they become, and both of them have become,
 you know, better than we are at those, at those tasks, but anything that we actually deploy is
 going to be, is going to be very quickly be at, at human level for about five minutes and then
 it'll be superhuman and it'll, it'll never be subhuman again, right? It's just like chess. You
 know, chess was not as good as you and me at one point. I don't know when that was maybe in the,
 in the 60s. And then it got better than the average person, but still not nearly as good as a,
 as a grandmaster. And there was some moment of, you know, human vanity that was, that, that was
 allowed to thrive for, I don't know, a decade and a half where these grandmasters imagined that
 they would always be better than chess engines. But then we had, you know, deep blue and, and
 beyond. I think the last time I spoke to Gary Kasparov about this, he still was imagining that,
 that human computer teams, the so-called cyborgs, would be better than any computer.
 And I bet him, I don't know what, I don't think we bet any money on it, but I, you know, it was,
 it was obvious to me that that was, that was going to expire eventually. Because at a certain point,
 once the machines get good enough, human beings can't help but just add noise, right? I mean,
 just the monkey in the, in the conversation is the, is this dumb agent in the conversation and you
 get him out of there and you just let the machine do the work, right? So that's going to, you know,
 I don't know if that's true now with chess. I have to think it's, if not now, it'll be next week.
 But at some point, once you admit that human cognition, you know, everything we care about,
 in terms of, of intelligence and its, its capacities to do work in the world,
 is just a matter of information processing. And it doesn't matter what sort of system that
 information is processed in. Well, then you have to admit that if we just keep making progress,
 it's just a matter of time before everything we care about cognitively can be implemented in
 our machines at a level that is superhuman. And then you have to just do the very short work of
 imagining what it will be like to be in relationship with an agent of that kind, right? Again,
 an agent that does not make human level mistakes. I mean, it's not to say that it would never make
 any mistake, but it's just that an agent that is, is effectively the smartest person you have ever
 met and the fastest thinker you have ever met. And it's got, you know, real time connect connectivity
 to the totality of human and machine knowledge every second of its life, right? It's cooked up
 to the internet. It knows everything we could possibly know and it knows it instantaneously.
 And every time it gets better, every copy of it gets better. And it never gets worse than that.
 You know, sorry, the worst version was the one you had yesterday. And it's self-improving,
 and it writes better computer code than any human. And it can do that to its own source code.
 And we let it do that because that was the way to make it better in the first place, right? And
 it was getting better and better and better. And now it's unaligned with us. And to say it's
 unaligned, we should say that it's got goals that we wish it didn't have, right? It suddenly starts
 doing things that are not in our best interests. And we say, no, no, wait a minute, we don't want
 to, we stop doing that. And now we're negotiating, right? Now, because we don't have complete this
 thing is embedded in everything we care about. It's the thing that we rely upon to keep our economy
 stable and to fight our wars. And I mean, like, there's how much have we seated over to the control
 of these systems and how united have they become under this thing. And now you're in the world of
 science fiction, talking to a machine that, you know, whether it's sentient or not certainly
 seem sentient, because we built it in that way, where it, you know, it's completely aware of our
 emotions and can cater to them and can and can control us and can talk in, you know,
 scarlet voice. And I mean, it's, it can do anything, right? Because we have built,
 we've integrated it with everything. That's, that's the potential problem, because the
 potential problem is that in the space of all possible minds, all possible superhuman minds,
 certainly most are not perfectly aligned with human well-being. Just as our minds are not
 perfectly aligned with, with the well-being of lesser creatures that we barely take notice of,
 right? And so like, and again, this is not the cartoon version of Terminator is not what you
 need to imagine here. It's not that a super intelligent AI would spontaneously become
 malevolent and want to kill us. It could just again, not be aligned in such a way that
 it could have goals that, that were unforeseeable by us, because this, that's what, that's what
 real intelligence is. I mean, it's certainly real superhuman intelligence is the kind of thing we
 can't foresee how it's going to evolve and change and what, what kind of instrumental
 goals it might develop. And we, in the same way that, that, that, you know, all these species that
 we destroy casually have no idea what we're doing and what we're up to and what we're doing it. And,
 and we can even seem to be their friends for the longest time, but then suddenly do something that's
 antithetical to their interests. I mean, the example I would, this is kind of a weird cartoon,
 but it sort of gets at the nature of the problem. You could imagine, imagine if dogs invented us,
 right? You have a species of dogs. They magically somehow give birth, you give rise to us as their
 protector species, we're their super intelligent AIs. And for 10,000 years, it really works out
 pretty well, right? I mean, we, we spent a lot of our resources taking care of our dogs and we,
 we mistreat some dogs, obviously in experiments and elsewhere, but leave that aside. For the most
 part, for most dogs, most of the time, human beings are great. You know, we procure them food,
 we wash them, we walk them, we just, you know, we're all, we love them as nearly as much as our own
 children. And yet, they have no idea what we're really up to and what we care about and what we're
 paying attention to most of the time. You're staring at your computer, your dog has no idea
 what you're doing. And yet you go take it for a walk and it seems to work out great. Now, if
 something happened, if we have a xenovirus that's jumping from dogs to humans and is 90% lethal.
 And so now we're suddenly in a situation where we recognize that our pets are going to kill our
 kids, right? Because, you know, through no fault of their own. And the only solution, the only real
 effective solution that we agree about is that we just have to euthanize our dogs, right? Like,
 we just have to, we have to start over. This is just, this is an emergency. This has to all happen
 on a Thursday. Now, obviously, there'll be some holdouts, but what's really going to happen is
 suddenly from the dog's point of view, all of these human beings that have loved them
 with all of their or thousands of years are just going to wake up one morning and start killing
 them, right? Now, for reasons they can't possibly understand could never be made to understand,
 right? So, you know, it's a cartoon example, but what it gets at is the consequence of much,
 much greater intelligence is that you can have priorities. Suddenly, you can have priorities
 that weren't there the day before that the lesser species can't possibly know about, right? The
 logic is, will be by definition, inscrutable. And yes, some people will argue that our machines
 could never, there's no super, there's no possible super intelligence that could get that far away
 from us because we're some kind of universal Turing machine that really can, in the limit,
 understand everything. I happen to, you know, somebody like David Deutsch, the physicist at
 Oxford is a champion of that kind of view. I'm skeptical of that, largely just for practical
 reasons. Like, you know, you have to imagine us merging with the machines to some considerable
 degree to be able to keep up with them in that sense. And you know, whether that's going to happen
 or not, you know, you have to imagine getting the stuff that literally stuck into your head
 as a cyborg technology. I'm not especially boosterish on that at the moment. But the
 general picture is one of building something more competent, more powerful, than we are,
 that it ultimately can improve itself, right? And that's the crucial step that we would make
 at our peril, I think. And yeah, again, then you then you're in a relationship, and then
 any negotiation begins to look like a chess game, you can't win, right? And to just the idea that
 we're going to constrain this technology, once it is fun, again, fundamentally general and
 more powerful than we are, it's somewhat analogous to saying, okay, we'll just, we'll play chess
 harder. We'll beat it with chat. Well, you know, we'll just, it's really matters. We're just going
 to play our best chess. And we're just going to beat this thing, right? There is no way of playing
 chess hard enough at this point to beat the best chess engine, right? But just isn't, right?
 In terms of the practicality, practicalities of how some of these things could affect our
 democracy and elections, and this is the last thing I'll ask you about, we saw last week a
 robo call go out in New Hampshire sounded just like Joe Biden. It wasn't. And there's, as far as I
 know, the culprits have not yet been found. Someone took one of my videos and cloned Tucker Carlson's
 voice and republished it as a Tucker Carlson video. It genuinely sounded like Tucker Carlson even
 to me until I said, there are some speech patterns in there that I recognize for myself. And I looked
 and it was a verbatim, my video, but it was Tucker Carlson eyesed. In terms of the practical impact
 in the immediate next 18 to 24 months from some of these tools on, on elections, how worried are you?
 Yeah. So you know, you're citing a very different class of problem with AI and, and with, you know,
 just our technology generally. And it's, you know, it's a much nearer term problem because it is here.
 And in and of itself, it's, it's well worth worrying about, right? So when you look at the way in which
 AI supercharges the problem of, of fraud and, you know, cyber attack and the misinformation on
 social media and conspiracy thinking, all of that is just that it's, you know, the cue and
 onification of our whole world, right? And it's by the more compelling it gets, the scarier it gets.
 And the, and once we cross over into a, into a situation where it's not just cute fakes that we,
 we detect and then laugh about, right? But it's, it's, it becomes undetectable by us and even
 but possibly by AI. I mean, I think there's, there's maybe an asymmetry here, which,
 which we can't get over, which is that the, the AI that allows for fraud is, is going to be,
 is going to always outrun the AI that allows for the detection of fraud.
 Right. And digital watermarks and other measures may be insufficient to deal with,
 with the, the, the provenance of, to make the provenance of all information always, you know,
 obvious. And again, I'm not, I certainly do not consider myself an expert in, you know, on those
 topics. I'm just, you know, I'm a consumer of, of journalism there as everybody else.
 But I think there are reasons to worry. It certainly sounds like there are reasons to worry that this
 is, some of these problems might be insoluble. So then we're living in a world where
 anyone for whatever sinister reason can just, you know, whether they're Steve Bannon or anyone
 else can just whip up a totally compelling, compelling piece of film footage to any purpose.
 Right. You know, just show me, give me a 30 minute documentary that proves that, you know,
 40% of the people coming across the southern border are jihadists. Right. And show me the,
 you know, show me the translated Arabic and the, you know, the speeches made by, you know,
 members of Hamas. And just give it, give it this needs to look like a frontline documentary.
 And it's, it's all on this topic. And you spend two weeks, you know, with the most powerful,
 creative AI, you know, two years from now on that, on that topic.
 Is that going to be, is it going to be even detectable that that's a fraud? Right. I don't know. But
 what does that do to us politically? I mean, we're all, I think we're already seeing
 the leading edge of that problem where even in the absence of compelling deep fakes,
 you have people fully siloed into their own information bubble. And they're just not
 disposed to come out. Right. They have enough self confirming misinformation to keep them there
 forever, effectively, right? Whether again, whether whether it's the anti-vaxx thing,
 or it's the QAnon thing, or it's, or it's on the left, you know, racism is worse now really than,
 than it's ever been or we've made no progress. Right. I mean, like you can spend, once you get
 enough narrative gravity on your, your favorite polarizing topic, you can find
 confirmation of your most, you know, cherished views, endlessly online, you know, based on who
 you follow on social media, based on the diet of, of, of, you know, sub stack newsletters you
 consume, the podcast you consume, and you become, you achieve a kind of escape velocity from
 everybody else. I mean, we're all sort of redshifted now where we're, you know, we're, the, the,
 the universe is every galaxy is receding from every other informationally, and it's, it's accelerating.
 And we, you know, I, I find some people now are effectively unreachable. I mean, maybe that's,
 that's always been a problem. Maybe people were always unreachable, you know, even when we just had,
 you know, a, a manual printing press, right? But it's, it all appears to be moving faster now,
 and it all appears to be, you know, just, I mean, things are hard. It's a paradox. We have more
 access information now with it should be easier now to disconfirm a lie than it's ever been.
 And yet lies and half truths are, are propped up by, you know, just an ocean of, of digital
 misinformation and disinformation and confirmation bias and, you know, every other cognitive problem.
 And it just, there's, there's, functionally, there's an unlimited amount of it now. And you see,
 you can, once you go down one of these rabbit holes, you can literally stay there forever.
 And that's, that somehow seems new to me.
 We've been speaking with neuroscientists, Sam Harris, philosopher, New York Times best-selling

The publishing scandal happening right now.wav,/Users/eddie/Dev/Alignment/public-calls-bot/data/processed/20230803_ACADEMIA IS BROKEN! The publishing scandal happening right now.txt,"Academia is broken. For years, the for-profit publishing system has absolutely taken the
 mic when it comes to exploiting academics. Academics help these billion dollar companies
 gain revenue by donating their time, first of all, producing the papers, then reviewing
 the papers. That is the peer review process where you look at other people's papers and
 say yes, so you're using your expertise. And then a number of academics see it as very
 prestigious to be an editor on a journal. And they do that for absolutely nothing. They
 do it for free and they do it for years. And this means that academics are fed up. And
 these companies are just trying to maximize their revenue. They have never had the intention
 of paying highly specialized, highly trained individuals to do work and the academics are
 starting to revolt. Let's take a look at that.
 The editor-in-chief of a Wiley journal called Biogiology has had enough. And here we can
 see he's released this blog post about why he's resigning. After almost four years as
 editor-in-chief with Journal of Biography, I've decided to step down. And that is because
 he has realized that Wiley has no interest in actually sort of like helping scientists.
 So look, he's very happy with what he's done over the years. But you can see down here
 the challenges are that he decided to speak out and ask Wiley for some help. And he's
 got all of these concerns. And Wiley are no longer willing even to try to explore these
 productive solutions. So you can read these for yourself. I'll leave a link in the description.
 But ultimately, it is about moving this journal from pay to access to pay to publish. And
 that is a huge issue. Essentially, you're saying to scientists here, you can publish
 in our papers if you pay for open access. Now, we all love the idea of open access, but
 these for-profit publishing companies are now using that to just increase their revenue.
 And the thing is, this really, really hurts the equality of publishing in science. Some
 institutions cannot afford these massive amounts of money for publishing in open access journals.
 And by changing to that, we are really limiting what science is published. In a tweet, Michael
 Dawson says, ""There is an argument to be made that several of these things in the current
 posting climate have the potential to exert unhealthy pressure on editorial decisions.
 And here he's saying he resigns because big publishers prioritize profit over access,
 journal quality, and open marketplace for ideas, whilst also eroding editorial independence
 and devaluing editors despite record revenues last year. Terrible, terrible situation for
 science. And these academics have had enough. And stay around to the end of the video because
 you'll see Wiley's response, which is a little bit lackluster and pathetic, in my opinion.
 And also, you'll see other journals that are doing the same thing.""
 So after Michael Dawson resigned, guess what happened? Wiley just said, ""Actually, you
 don't need to see it at your ten-year-ship. Let's just let you go."" They essentially fired
 him from his position because I guess they were just so upset that they're like, ""We've
 got to do something."" But that is excellent. Because what's happened is that other associate
 editors are completely fed up as well. And you can see here that there is a work stoppage.
 So a large majority, 85% of the associate editors of that journal have decided to stop
 work beginning immediately. And that was at the end of June 2023. And it is still unresolved.
 And so this is fantastic. This is academics taking back control. Essentially, without academics
 providing free labor and free advice and knowledge to these journals, there are no journals. That
 is it. So they really are affecting the bottom line of Wiley here. And I feel like this is
 only the tip of the iceberg. This is the letter that's been released. We are writing to inform
 you that we as associate editors of the journal of biogeography are currently unwilling to
 handle any new manuscripts due to a difference of opinion on the full open access model proposed
 increase in throughput of the journals. Essentially, the journal was saying, ""No, no, no. You're
 not doing enough free work for us. Let's do a little bit more free work for us, shall we?""
 And also the automatic referral to other Wiley journals. So, you know, it is not about keeping
 your science or your papers in one ecosystem. We're not about maximizing Wiley's profits
 as academics. We need to make sure your paper goes to the best journal, not just one that
 we are editors for. And that is not what they really like to do because Wiley want the money.
 So, they are firmly against this option because it takes away other author choice and editorial
 discretion. So, that is the current state is you've got these people just saying, ""You
 know what? If you're going to treat us poorly, we're not going to do work."" Sounds an awful
 like industrial action to me. I love it. There's other people who are speaking out. Just here
 in May, 2023, the editors of Neurology Imaging Journal resigned to start a new publication
 in protest that author fees, brilliant. You can see here that the fees were set at $3,450
 to publish in that journal, but the departed editors estimate the actual cost of publication
 was about $1,000 or less. So, where's all that extra money going? Straight into the
 for-profit publishing company's bank account. I love that these editors, they're just going
 to be like, ""You know what? We are the driving force. We'll just start our own journal.
 I absolutely love it."" And here we are. This is what Wiley has to say. We are disappointed
 to receive the work stoppage notice for the journal of bio-geography, and that our response
 did not fully mitigate the editor's concerns. Of course not. Of course they didn't. That's
 why they're doing this. Listen. We appreciate the concerns shared by the members of the
 editorial team and acknowledge they are not always perfect solutions. No, they're not
 perfect. And what they mean by this is it's not perfect for maximizing profit. We thank
 all of the editors for their work. Come on now. Come on. That is the most pathetic way
 of saying thank you for all of the profit that you've driven to this company because
 you have shared your expertise, your time, your energy, and a lot of your time that you could
 otherwise be spending on research to build our company. We are working on plans for the
 future of the journal, and our priorities continue delivering the research that serves
 the bio-geography community. This is a nothing statement. This shows that they have no interest
 in actually furthering the work of science and much more focus on actually building up profit
 for shareholders. I think this is the start of something big. Start of something that will
 change the academic publishing game. I think more academics are becoming fed up with donating
 their time for free to do all of the work for these billion dollar companies. Start to think
 about where you're publishing, how you're publishing, and if you can, start to speak out.
 People in the positions of power, editors, associate editors in these full profit publishing companies
 hold the key to making this a better publishing environment for everyone. So if you're in that
 position, think about speaking to the publisher about what they can do to make it better for science.
 And I think this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to industrial action by editors and
 associate editors of big name journals. We hold the power, we hold the knowledge, we are the workforce,
 and now it's about time to use that power for good. Let me know in the comments what you think.
 So there we have it. That is the current state and the scandal of the academic publishing game.

 that from our angle, that we've conquered the universities and we've conquered them
 here. It really doesn't feel like it.
 If we accept the premise that objectivity is never quite possible, but as Phil said,
 we should be striving for it, what would be a healthy alternative? My answer to that
 would be that we have a public square or a national conversation that is as intellectually
 diverse and vibrant as possible, that we genuinely have a range of views and perspectives and
 beliefs and voices within that national conversation. So at least we can interrogate and explore
 various truths as we see them. But that is not happening today. That is partly why we saw
 the political volatility of the last 13 years. It's why 2024 will likely be a return to 2016
 in many ways because many voters out there are looking at the media and have been looking
 at the media class and increasingly feel that viewpoint diversity, we talk endlessly about
 diversity except when it comes to intellectual diversity and viewpoint diversity, isn't
 really there. And that's also true, by the way, where I work, the universities. If you
 look, for example, at Britain's universities, the ratio of left-wing to right-wing academics
 has gone from three to one in the 1960s to closer to ten to one today. I do think that's
 a problem. So within the context of this national conversation, I think we've lost something
 quite special, which is why the media landscape, as I say, is fragmenting at the pace at which
 it is. I mean, if you look at our flagship media programs, Radio 4 today, lost 2 million
 listeners since Brexit, you look at the rise of new entrants, as I say, GV News, talk TV,
 YouTube, online space and so on, all of that. And also, by the way, the collapse of public
 confidence in media. All of that, I think, is reflective of the way in which many voters
 have now come to the conclusion that the viewpoint diversity that should be there,
 that should be giving expression to values that are held by much of the rest of the country
 but are not necessarily held by the people in the corridors of power, is not really there.
 So the alternative in my mind would be reforming the institutions, ensuring that people who
 are in the media class are not just the sons and daughters of senior journalists, that
 we actually have a serious sustained attempt to get different voices and values onto the
 comment pages, into the newspapers, into the universities, that the epistemic class, which
 determines what is socially acceptable and what is not socially acceptable, is broadened
 out. And I think that, in turn, would perhaps get us closer to this idea of having a vibrant
 public square.
 Go for it, Phil.
 I agree we want the most, the widest possible plurality of voices and range of opinion. I
 agree to that it's narrower than it should be. But one of those opinions, one of those
 opinions I want in there, one of those ways of approaching information, is to have some
 impartial voices. That's precisely what I think, where I think it sits, that I don't
 think being entirely objective and being impartial and quite the same thing either. But to have
 within the landscape of enormously proliferating voices, some institutions who have a public
 service regulatory obligation to seek to tell the truth as they see it, whilst we accept
 if we're going to erect a high philosophical standard, we're going to judge them as failures,
 I think that's a really weak reason for not trying that. I think there's very significant
 successes in British journalism with respect to the reporting of the news.
 It is, I repeat, a very different thing from offering an opinion. Non-a-vos are under any
 obligation to be impartial. It will be a very boring debate if we were. This is an exchange
 of views. There's no requirement for impartiality here, quite the country. But when you're reporting
 the news on the six o'clock news, the ten o'clock news, to then attempt as far as you
 can to tell the truth as it is and say nothing that is not true, and to weigh it for news
 value, these are noble things to do. They do not amount to an absolutely definitive and
 determinate idea of impartiality, of course they don't. But nevertheless, it's still
 different for what I do in the times. I think that's the central point here, that within
 that plurality, there is space for that kind of institution. One other point is I take the
 point that the plurality isn't as wise as it should be, but firstly, I think that the
 online journalism has proliferated it enormously. I think that the days in which is quite interesting
 we're here a couple of days after Rupert Murdoch steps down from the top job at News
 UK. In a sense is the end of an era. The notion that the media that I have worked in
 exercises, the kind of power they claimed when they claimed the sun won the 1992 general
 election, I think will be ridiculous. I think if I put it the other way, and I said, I'm
 a comment writer for the time, so every Monday you will all wake up if your time is readers
 with no ideas in your head, and you will then gain your opinions from what I tell you, you
 don't think I was patronising stupid. And yet that's the kind of idea you get of media
 power sometimes, so I don't buy the idea of media power quite like that. I think it's
 a conversation between people. I think big media institutions and the time is a very good
 example, follow their readers as much as they lead them, and the Brexit referendum was a
 very good case in point where all of the senior people at the times were Brexitiers,
 all of them, but the times readers were 70/30 for remaining the European Union, so the paper
 took that view. It absolutely took that view because it was following its readers. Commercial
 decision, it's got nothing to do with any propaganda, anything like that, pure capitalism.
 And that happens all the time. The institutions follow their readers as much as they lead
 them, so I don't buy this sort of tabular rather view of the people that they're simply taking
 in. I think it's patronising. One final thought, the media does expand a bit. It's
 not entirely inelastic, so when Jeremy Corbyn was leading a Labour Party, for example,
 a few voices did emerge who were pro-corbing voices, as indeed they should have done.
 You know, Owen Jones, Ash Saka, Grace Blakely, Aaron Vostani, there were people out there
 who were pro-corbing voices. Probably not enough, but nevertheless, it wasn't entirely impervious
 to change.
 Well, I mean, again, some really interesting ideas here. I actually find myself appropriately
 enough, kind of, I agree with elements of both of what my fellow panellists have said,
 and then I sort of think I might be diverging up again and yet in other directions. So the
 idea that you would have certain regulatory organisations or institutions that somehow,
 I mean, Philip, I follow you correctly, what we're almost talking about is sort of creating
 some sort of regulatory bodies that actually are almost slightly out of the flow of the
 practical realities of what media and journalism are today, because obviously...
 We have it already.
 We have it already.
 We have it already.
 The obligations of the BBC and ICV and Channel 4, that's all.
 Exactly. So we have those mechanisms in place, and we ought to be sort of giving them sort
 of tougher, more robust powers, perhaps, or maybe trying to extend their capacity, not
 just to advise, but to actually act or impose it, and that's interesting. I think actually
 I would come back to Matt's point, this idea about what's really at stake and what I think
 I would say is important going forward is to do plurality in media better and actually
 have genuinely more, I mean, so there's two ways you can do, you can approach this sort
 of impartiality, or you can either say, right, well, we're going to represent a lot more
 viewpoints, we're going to do so thoroughly, not in a sort of quick shock-jock, flash-headline
 way or a way that's been incredibly marginalised. I don't know if anyone's following at the
 moment, some of the very fraught media coverage of the voice debate in Australia, which is
 heading into a referendum about whether indigenous people should have a permanent voice in parliament,
 and that is a classic example of how actually there's an absolute barrage of media coverage
 on this topic constantly, and yet actually if you drill into it a bit closer, you're
 talking very few genuinely diverse different sorts of opinions represented. I must admit
 Matt, as someone who's sort of leftward leading but sort of not kind of institutionally
 committed, shall we say, I'm quite thrilled to hear that the left's doing so well because
 it doesn't look like that from our angle, that we've conquered the universities and
 we've conquered them, it really doesn't feel like it, it actually feels like the complete
 opposite, and actually I think, again, representing a diverse viewpoint here would say that actually
 we're hearing the other voices coming through louder and stronger and clearer, and that's
 why I mentioned the Australia case, for example, where what you've got there is a quite incredible
 case study of going in to that referendum, we had a clear lead for the traditionally liberal
 kind of yes vote, yes we should have a committee in Canberra for indigenous people, excellent,
 that's what we all want, and then an astonishing combination of the right and the right's ability
 to tell stories that the media can pick up and spread quickly and not just through traditional
 media but other forms of this new online world which I think is just so resistant to
 any form of traditional regulation, we've had a complete change, a complete transformation
 of that result and it is not looking good for the yes vote come October, so I suppose
 I'm interested in following up or going further with this idea of how you genuinely do plurality
 in the media, I think the other question we have to ask here at this juncture as well
 is who is evaluating truth because that has become obviously an incredibly important central
 question not only in newsrooms across the world but also in households at the dinner
 table, we now sit around many people, families and argue about what is true which is something
 that I think is you know Donald Trump spoke to when he said that we were kind of a bit
 over truth, we'd gone past the era of truth and into a kind of post-truth age, perhaps
 he is also someone who's been part of that, I think speaking about regulatory bodies is
 difficult here with that in mind because of course how do we ensure that those bodies
 are trying to fulfill an urge to a striving for actual truth, if we are so unsure ourselves
 as to what actual truth is?
 Well, that's for you Matt, that's a big one for Matt.
 Yeah, I'm going to come back to that, let me just quickly pick up on the universities
 point and then I'm going to come back to the truth point because in a way even though we're
 talking about media there is probably no institution in society that proclaims itself to be as
 committed to truth and objectivity and impartiality as universities and if you don't think universities
 lean to the left I would be really curious to see what your day-to-day experience is
 like in your university because in my view and let me be provocative because we're not
 all here to get along and agree, let me just say one thing, the universities in this country
 have completely given up on any pretense to be objective, independent, impartial institutions.
 And if you disagree with that, give me one day and I'll give you a tour of universities
 and show you what I mean, they become openly political organizations and in some ways that's
 how they started, they started as very religious institutions that were pushing an agenda but
 in the mid 20th century, late 20th century, there was an attempt to commit to truth seeking
 and impartiality and objectivity, today that is simply no longer the case.
 Ideological litmus tests are used across the board if you want to get research grants,
 if you want to get jobs, if you want to get promoted, if you challenge the liberal consensus,
 if you challenge things like gender identity theory, opposition to Brexit, particular interpretations
 of British history, you basically will experience some form of indirect or direct discrimination
 and if you want the evidence of that, there's a lovely book in the tent over there called
 Valley's Voice and Virtue which will present all of the evidence to you.
 And the reason I point to that is because in a way it's reflective of what's happening
 in other aspects of our national life.
 For those who do challenge this narrow orthodoxy within our public square, that is basically
 anti-Brexit, pro-globalization, pro-migration, socially liberal, which basically speaks
 to about 20% of the country, if you look at the British Social Attitude Survey, the latest
 edition came out last week, it suggests that 20% of Britain are strongly and consistently
 socially liberal on a whole range of issues.
 If you challenge some of those assumptions, some of those beliefs, you are variously told
 that you are buying into misinformation, that you are pursuing half-truths or you have
 been manipulated by media and so on and so forth, to the point where even fact checkers
 and reality checks and so on, if you look at them closely, are basically becoming openly
 partisan, is what I would argue.
 Right, can I just, so if you challenge this consensus, you will find yourself essentially
 being gatly by many institutions.
 So if you ask yourself the question, why are so many people rebelling politically, culturally,
 socially, it is because when they look at these institutions they do not see people
 like them who reflect their worldview, what can we do about it?

 Today I'm speaking with Chris Anderson.
 Chris has been the curator of the famous TED conference since 2001.
 The tagline of TED is ""Idea's Worth Spreading,"" of which there have been many first shared at TED.
 The title of his new book is ""Infectious Generosity,"" the ultimate idea worth spreading.
 And that is in part the topic of today's conversation.
 We talk about the new spirit of cynicism that seems to surround any notion of doing good in the world in tech and finance at the moment.
 The problems with diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI.
 The controversy that enveloped Coleman Hughes when he spoke at TED last year.
 And then we get into the topic of Chris's book, ""Proper.""
 We talk about the science of generosity, the leverage offered by the internet, the false opposition between selfishness and selflessness,
 mixed motives in giving, results versus reward, trying to see the good in people,
 digital business models, including my own business model for this podcast,
 the economics of TED, TEDx, wealth inequality, the ethics of billionaires, philanthropy at scale,
 the power of pledges, the arguments of Peter Singer, the Sam Bankman Fried scandal,
 and the problems with effective altruism, how to improve our digital lives, and other topics.
 Is there a more important topic than trying to figure out how to inspire the luckiest among us to do more good in the world?
 Given the implications, I'm not sure.
 And now I bring you Chris Anderson.
 I am here with Chris Anderson.
 Chris, thanks for joining me.
 It's great to be here, Sam.
 So you have a new book, ""Infectious Generosity,"" the ultimate idea worth spreading,
 which I want to talk about, which it seems like now is the moment for such a book.
 It's really great that you've written this.
 But most people will know you as the owner and curator and impresario of the TED conference.
 What did you do professionally before TED?
 I was a journalist at a university.
 I think I originally wanted to be a physics professor, but I found physics very hard at Oxford
 and switched course partway through to politics and philosophy and ended up as a journalist.
 And then fell in love with computers in the early 1980s and started a magazine publishing company for hobbyist, nerdy computer mags,
 which turned out to be very fortunate timing, and the company did well.
 Came to America, eventually, continued to grow it, and then had a horrible tangle with the
 dot-com crash of 2000-2001, ended up leaving the company, which had gone public by this
 stage, but left it and did the sideways move into TED, which was a conference I first went
 to in 1998 and kind of fell in love with it, and had a chance, surprisingly, to buy it from
 the owner.
 I didn't have any money because of the dot-com bus, but I did have a foundation.
 So it was the foundation that bought TED, so it found itself in a non-profit, and that's
 been most of my time since then, really, since 2001.
 When you say you had a horrible tangle with the dot-com bus, were you one of these people
 who had a billion dollars on paper and then watched it get halved every 15 minutes until
 it vanished over the course of a day, I mean, was it that kind of experience, or what exactly
 happened?
 Pretty much.
 I'm not sure I quite, maybe for five minutes after one company went public, hit the billion
 mark, but very quickly fell away, and for 18 months, I basically lost on average a million
 dollars a day, and it's not just that it, I mean, it really eats your sort of sense
 of self-worth, I mean, because I'd told this fantasy to myself that I was a, you know,
 a successful entrepreneur, everything had always gone up into the right, and, you know, the
 company for years, the company kind of doubled in size every year, and it just felt, you
 know, easy and great.
 And then this happened, and I, and it was a real lesson really, don't tie up too much
 of your happiness and sense of self-worth into your business or what you do, or, you
 know, it's a recipe for disappointment.
 So I went through a very difficult 18 months and kind of got survived it, I think, by reading
 and getting, just entering, remembering how amazing the world of ideas is and how much
 cool science was happening, I hadn't really discovered evolutionary biology, there was
 so many things that I got into for the first time, and that made the prospect of a moving
 to TED and sort of living in that world incredibly appealing.
 I mean, at the time it was an annual conference, nothing else, but hey, all these interesting
 people, and it felt like a real respite from the ugliness of, you know, the dot-com crash,
 where, you know, I had 2,000 people at one point, we had to let go of half of them, and
 it was just so painful, it was a very, it was a horrible time.
 Well, I want to talk about wealth and philanthropy and all these, these interesting issues.
 I mean, TED has given you a front row seat to see the social phenomenon I want to discuss,
 and many of which are related to the topic of your book, which is briefly, you've written
 a book about how we can do more good in the world through leveraging new norms around
 generosity, and especially as it becomes possible in the age of the internet.
 I mean, really, it changes the possibility of being generous in interesting ways.
 But before we jump into that, I want to acknowledge that there's this new spirit of cynicism
 in the air wherein it seems that almost any conspicuous efforts to do good in the world
 now seem suspect, and that this relates to various degrees to things like ESG, environmental
 social and governance investing, effective altruism, DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion
 efforts, and there's this sense, especially among influential people in tech and in finance,
 that all of this stuff amounts to a little more than a sanctimonious scam.
 I'll just virtue signaling, it's just elites marketing to elites, and I've been critical
 of many of these things, and I'm actually especially critical of DEI at the moment.
 But I'm also worried that what we have here is a situation in which some of the luckiest
 and smartest people in the world appear to have drawn the wrong lesson from some specific
 recent embarrassments, and they appear to now think that altruism and generosity and
 compassion are basically bogus, and we're all just condemned to live in a world where
 we play this game for ourselves, and perhaps our family and a few friends make it into
 the lifeboat with us, but otherwise we should just be narrowly selfish without apology.
 And in fact, there's an attraction to this, I mean, really the apotheosis of this is someone
 like Trump, where you have half the country idolizing a man who makes no pretense of being
 other than malignantly selfish, right, and if you can be just, you just nakedly selfish
 and merely selfish, one of the superpowers you acquire is that it's impossible to be
 a hypocrite, and it's the moments of hypocrisy that many people have found so despicable
 in our efforts to do good.
 So you have someone like Sam Bankman Freed, or you have the DEI bureaucrats who are apparently
 unable to condemn calls for genocide against the Jews, it's just very easy to see what
 is wrong here.
 I mean, I'm thinking of one with respect to ESG now, you have, I guess you had the spectacle
 of lots of right thinking people flying on their private jets to a climate conference,
 right?
 People see this, and now they've begun to default to a new norm of cynicism and selfishness.
 And so I'm just, I want to talk about the problems such as they are with ESG and effective
 altruism and DEI and these other issues.
 But I'm wondering if you share my concern that the pendulum is in the process of swinging
 back into something like an iron Randian and fairly psychopathic ethic of basically no
 social responsibility.
 Yeah, I think you're right to be concerned.
 I'm certainly worried about it.
 I think different people would probably tell the story in different ways.
 But there's no question that the techno-optimism of say the early 2000s, when it really seemed
 like you could frame the internet, for example, as bringing the world together, lots of people
 had the narrative that, wow, this is wonderful.
 We can see people on the other side of the world.
 Maybe this exciting new technology can spread things like freedom and democracy and some
 of the ideas that we care about.
 And the narrative of the last 10 years has been the opposite of that.
 It's been, and I've felt it.
 I felt it through my ringside seat at TED, if you like, of this growing sort of sense
 of crushing disappointment that the internet was not doing what we thought it would do.
 It was actually helping engender the opposite.
 And yeah, somewhere around the rise of social media, the election of Donald Trump, the world
 became very, very, very divided.
 And it was almost the only thing you could be was to pick a tribe and then fight and be
 really annoyed at the other side.
 And those were the most sort of fervent conversations.
 I mean, I think, and I hope, that a lot of people have got really sick at how mean the
 world has become.
 And actually, you're right that there is a lot of cynicism and exhaustion at the way
 I would frame it, Sam, I think is almost the language that each side has sort of fallen
 into.
 So the language of DEI has become its own sort of sing-song thing that is almost invisible
 to the people who are in it.
 And it just sounds so exhausting and mind-numbing and annoying to people who aren't.
 And it makes it impossible to have actually a conversation about the real things that
 are underlying it, that the reason why DEI happened originally was that there were injustices
 in the world and that there were groups of people who hadn't been given a fair shot and
 there was a need and a desire from good-thinking people to try to do something about that.
 But it warped into tribalistic language, that's the shocker, so that you couldn't even have
 a discussion about the actual merits of the case.
 It was just, ""Oh, you use that word.
 I know who you are.
 I can't talk to you.
 You make me sick.""
 And it's sort of, I think, and I hope that there are a lot of people who have got really
 weary of that world and that there's a desire, and certainly in the generation coming through.
 But I think, in our generation as well, that this can't go on.
 And part of my sense of urgency about this is, if we can't figure out how to start listening
 to each other, talking to each other, working together, collaborating, we're not going to
 be able to solve any of the giant problems that the future is sort of throwing up.
 And whether it's climate, whether it's wars around the world, whether it's artificial
 intelligence and the challenges that that poses, we're not going to be able to solve
 any of this stuff.
 And so I see that there is no way forward other than to at least to try to tackle this.
 And I guess the framing that I've come up with and I'm excited by is that just as nasty
 things have gone viral online in the last decade, especially fear, resentment, disgust,
 anger, it is also possible for really good things to go viral.
 There is no reason why they shouldn't.
 And with a bit of a nudge and a bit of a rethink and an effort by people of goodwill,
 I think there just might be a chance to turn the tide.
 At least that's the ambition.
 And if we don't do this, I don't know what else we do because the future is just going
 to be so ugly.
 Well, I thought to save a discussion of DEI to the end.
 But since we've touched on it on the fly, I think we may be able to take a brief detour
 and talk about it because it's not, it is a bit of a sidebar discussion with respect
 to the other topics that relate directly to generosity and philanthropy and wealth,
 et cetera.
 You know, I've always viewed you before I came to know you at all as a kind of prisoner
 of sorts of TED with respect to DEI.
 And perhaps you had a bit of Stockholm syndrome too, I don't know.
 But it just seemed like -- it's actually the first moment I noticed this was after I gave
 my first TED talk where I took a pretty hard line against traditional Islam, in particular
 the compulsory valing of women.
 And you came up on stage afterwards and tried to perform a bit of an intervention.
 And people can watch that on YouTube and draw their own conclusions and you and I have
 since talked a fair amount about Islam and my approach to criticizing it, and as well
 as my approach to criticizing religion in general.
 And you know, we've hashed that out on your podcast and in private.
 So we don't have to rehash that here unless you feel free to say anything you want and
 edify me in front of my audience here.
 But it's been useful to talk to you about all that.
 But what I want to talk about is a recent event that had somewhat the same character,
 but was notable in that it revealed how much had changed in the intervening years.
 So when we first met, when I gave that first TED talk, I think that was 2010.
 And so now a decade plus, hence, you have an event which produces much more controversy.
 And yet the target of the blowback was to my eye far more anodyne than I was giving that
 first TED talk.
 In fact, it made me think that there's no way I could have given that TED talk now, or
 at least last year.
 And so I'm talking about the case of Coleman Hughes.
 What happened there?
 What was your perception of what happened there?
 I wasn't actually at that conference, I wasn't there for the immediate dominoes fall, but
 I just heard about it after the fact.
 What was your experience of that?
 So just two words on your own TED talk, I actually really liked your TED talk.
 What I was there, the person who came up on stage there was nothing to do with DEI.
 This was a person who had lived for years as a kid growing up in Afghanistan and Pakistan
 with a lot of Muslims.
 And I do dislike huge aspects of actually lots of religions and I think living for paradise
 rather than the current world is incredibly, incredibly dangerous.
 I think the whole imshallah, it can be a very disempowering way to live where people give
 up trying because they just, God will do whatever he will do.
 There's lots that I don't like, but what I do like is that there are some genuinely,
 I just got to know many super spiritual Muslims and many Muslim women who actually liked aspects
 of the conservatism of Muslim culture and preferred it to the excesses of the West,
 the excessive public sexuality of the West.
 So it was a kind of ex-missionary kid, if you like, and speaking and challenging you.
 But the core of what you said in that talk was incredible, Sam.
 The notion of building morality from the ground up based on science, based on what we know
 about human nature.
 I think that's, I actually believe that because that's what opens the door to moral progress,
 which I think is a real thing.
 I think cultural relativism is a disastrous philosophy.
 And so we probably had more in line than you thought, but I was probably aware of some
 Muslims in the audience and just wanted to look out for them.
 So common use, the narrative online in some, depending on whether you look on the left
 or on the right.
 One narrative is that we invited a controversial man to give a talk about, he made the case
 for colorblindness.
 On the left, this is seen as a super controversial, in fact, and also deeply upsetting to some
 people because on the left, the view is that colorblind policies over decades have been
 proven not to work.
 We're still here with a lot of racial injustice and that you cannot make enough progress without
 proactively making decisions based on race, in some cases, there's a very good talk, I
 think, by Melody Hobson arguing exactly for this, be colorblind, not colorblind.
 And she, you know, actually persuaded me to be more conscious in how we hide.
 It's not about tokenistic hiring, it's about just making extra effort to find great people
 and that with a more diverse employee base, you actually get a lot more done and it's
 just healthier or round.
 So I get that argument from the left and I also get why, you know, what happened when
 Coleman gave his talk is that some people were heard it as, ""You no longer care about
 my identity,"" and so some people in the community were really upset by it, it's true to say.
 That meant that we had, some people internally were troubled at the notion of pushing it
 out online and wondered whether we showed whether it really was an idea of us spreading
 and they felt that some of the issues sort of really needed further debate given how
 sensitive it was.
 So Coleman kindly agreed to do a debate and he did, I thought he did very well in it and
 that was posted and that was fine.
 And then we posted his talk and all well and good so far, the talk was not included in
 one of our super popular podcasts for a while.
 I think the team were uncomfortable with it for whatever reason, I actually wasn't really
 aware of this.
 It meant that the view count on Coleman's talk was low compared with other talks and
 someone pointed this out to him and so he got upset and posted this piece saying, ""Why
 is Ted afraid of colorblindness?""
 Okay, and so the main pushback we got then was from people right of center who were outraged
 that this brilliant person, a Coleman is a brilliant person, was being suppressed by
 the woke Ted team and I was told, ""Well, if you believe in Coleman and you want to champion
 him, fire your woke staff and so forth.""
 And so there was, as is common in the current moment, you had incredibly different narratives
 on left and on right.
 I think on the right the narrative is, this proves that Ted is woke and is suppressing
 very smart centrist ideas, articulately espoused by a very good person.
 But an alternative framing of it is, Ted fought to bring to the stage someone who actually
 three or four years ago, five years ago in the midst of the political division that was
 there.
 We would never have invited to the stage.
 We brought him on.
 A lot of people in the community noticed and were excited that we were opening the tent
 wider than has been typical in recent years.
 And last time I checked, that talk has now has 800,000 views.
 It has been on the podcast.
 My own framing of it, Sam, is that Ted is on a, I think it's true that in the height
 of the sort of political division, when we did stuff that was political, most of it came
 from the progressive side of the equation.
 We had talks with some of that language that I referred to that ends up being very irritating
 to people on the other side.
 We are fighting to address that.
 First of all, just on the language, it is pointless having a talk about social justice,
 if the people you want to persuade aren't going to hear it because of the language.
 And so we have to get the language said right.
 But more generally, Ted is nonpartisan and I feel strongly that there are people in the
 center and so forth who we need to listen to more and bring to Ted.
 And I think when people see the line up for Ted 24, they can realize that we are absolutely
 committed to a broader open tent, we're unafraid of controversy.
 And as well as ideas, we're spreading.
 We're ideas worth debating.
 You often don't know whether an idea is worth spreading in the current environment.
 You have to really hammer it out.
 So that's where I'm at right now.
 I've been a fan of Coleman for a long time.
 I get why some people were upset by this talk.
 I think he's a brilliant thinker on issues outside race when I've heard him.
 I've always been wowed and I'm very glad he came to Ted.
 And I think ultimately the story is Ted, after a lot of internal debate, offers its platform
 to a voice who never would have been offered it a few years ago.
 Well, that's interesting.
 So my reaction to that is I don't think will surprise you.
 It may sound like a mere confession of my own bias here.
 But when I look at Coleman, who he is, and what he's said over the years and written,
 and as you say, he's quite brilliant, he's quite inspiring.
 He was this prodigy that many of us were very happy to discover.
 I don't know how many years ago it was, but as an undergraduate at Columbia, he was writing
 really useful and beautiful essays that they were like arrows shot directly to the heart
 of our various social problems at that time.
 And quite uncharacteristically, if someone his age, he did not overwrite at all.
 I mean, it was really quite beautiful.
 And yet, of course, for me to spell out his eloquence at length is considered a microagression
 given the color of his skin among many people over there at Ted.
 And so to hear your description of this was to hear the description of largely a pathology.
 I mean, for you to say that Coleman wouldn't have been invited a few short years ago, because
 of how controversial it would have been then and his invitation this time around didn't
 escape controversy as you just described.
 And when you look at what his talk was, his talk was just, as I said, truly anodyne.
 It was just this reboot of Martin Luther King Jr's dream that we get past the superficial
 characteristics that seem to divide us based on this insane obsession with race and get
 to caring about people on the basis of their actual contributions to society and the content
 of their character, et cetera, et cetera.
 That was never controversial until it suddenly became controversial.
 And if the only issue was that we have learned in the intervening years that it simply doesn't
 work, the colorblindness while it might sound ethically wonderful, it's quixotic and it's
 ineffective and we need to make more muscular efforts to promote people, even past their
 point of competence, even just the kind of affirmative action that many people deride
 now.
 Let's say we want to make an argument for that.
 The thing that it was so bizarre about the response Coleman received from, again, I don't
 know how many people it did, was that his utterly straightforward and unemotional, and
 again, traditional civil rights talk, was received as an attack, as an insult, as just
 pure a program, heaped on a vulnerable constituency, and these people perceive themselves to be
 under threat in the face of the least threatening guy and the least threatening message they
 could get.
 Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, I get that response from you and I get why a lot of people see it that
 way.
 It does seem anodyne.
 It does seem obvious.
 So at the conference, there was a standing ovation for the talk from some people, some
 people were really delighted, you know, Tedusa is a lot of different things and some people
 were super delighted at the talk.
 I think the piece that you may have missed and some of the people who think, oh, this
 is just obvious, I think you may have missed just how deep and complex this debate has
 become.
 People who have spent their whole lives, you know, fighting to address issues of racial
 injustice, and they have come to believe that straightforward colorblindness, it has not
 worked.
 It has not worked.
 And I don't think that the alternative to that is just sort of tokenism of, you know,
 it's not necessarily affirmative action.
 It may well, there are many reasons why people of color may not be in a position to, let's
 say, apply for a job in the same numbers and in the same way as others.
 A color bold policy might well be just to look that much harder, to find the brilliant
 people.
 They may well be out there.
 And so with respect to you, yourself aren't always colorblind.
 I will bet anything that there are times when you look at your podcast lineup and say,
 I can't just have a lineup of white guys, you know, you feel that.
 I bet you feel that.
 I actually, I actually know, and that's, you know, I don't believe you.
 No, no, I'll get, let me, I'll just be completely transparent to you.
 I mean, it's been pointed out to me that, you know, I don't have enough people of color,
 I don't have enough women, et cetera, et cetera.
 And so I've heard that criticism, but the truth is I simply reach out for the next topic
 of interest or the next person who has caught my attention.
 And obviously I can't say that I'm colorblind because, I mean, take the case of Coleman.
 What what I hope for in our world and in my own life and in, you know, and for Coleman
 is to get to a place where no one cares that he's black.
 He doesn't have to care about it.
 I don't care about it.
 Of course, given our current situation, given the topic of this conversation, it is highly
 relevant that he's black for a whole host of reasons.
 First of all, had a white guy given that same talk, had I had the temerity to come back
 and give a talk on colorblindness, you would have received much more controversy.
 And I would have received much less defense than Coleman did purely, but based on the
 color of our skins.
 And that makes no sense because the argument stands or falls on its merits.
 But I just think it's unfortunate and it will soon become a travesty if a man of Coleman's
 intelligence has to spend all of his time, most of his time, even much of his time talking
 about race simply because he's black.
 He has so much more to contribute on so many other topics.
 It's a massive opportunity cost and when I when I'm with Coleman, I very quickly forget
 that he's black because it doesn't matter to me.
 It only matters to me when suddenly we're talking about this issue and I have to turn
 to him and say, listen, you have a superpower based on how you look.
 You should be doing something that I'm not doing over here.
 And that's a totally rational conversation to have with him.
 But I view it as an opportunity cost and I view it as something that we have to outgrow.
 I just think it's exactly, I mean, the heuristic here, and I would be interested to know if
 you actually don't share this vision, I hope that someday skin color is like hair color
 or eye color, where we get to a place where no one would even think to ask how many blondes
 got into Harvard last year, knowing how many green eyed people are cardiologists and does
 it perfectly match their representation in the rest of society?
 Who cares?
 We have to get to the who cares moment.
 That's what success will look like.
 And the people who reacted so badly to Coleman's talk are people who not only don't think we
 can get there fast enough by pretending to be colorblind, they don't even want to get
 there, apparently.
 They want to enshrine these differences among people as indelible, as true for all time
 and as important for all time.
 And I just think that's the only other people who want to do that in our society are white
 supremacists, right?
 They have the same logic and it's toxic.
 So it may be true that some people want that permanently, but I don't think that is the
 general picture.
 And I think this is actually where we can find common ground.
 When I did a podcast interview with Melody Hobson, who'd made the argument against colorblindness,
 and I actually asked this very question, I said, ""In the long term, do you dream of
 a world where race as an issue goes away and that we just relate to each other as individuals?""
 And, you know, there was a long pause.
 And she said that's incredibly hard to articulate for, just because I see so many issues in the
 immediate term of why that approach isn't working.
 But long term, at least what I hear to say is that that is the dream.
 And I think most of the people at TED who were upset by the talk, and I include a couple
 of close friends of mine, would absolutely say that long term we want colorblind society,
 that is the dream.
 But in their view, the way to accelerate that is to look specifically at some of the issues
 around race and try and tackle them directly.
 So look, to me, this is a really important debate, and I'm very glad we had it at TED.
 And I think the way, you know, I think common was embraced by many, many, many people at
 TED.
 And as a whole, you should know, the world should know that we are committed to having
 an open stance to important, what are often controversial issues, and to not be owned
 by one tribe.
 And I think the tribalism is the biggest problem.
 So it's the fact that so few people are willing to explore and live in the very uncomfortable
 space between the tribes.
 I think that actually most people in America, in Europe, in the world, are not at the extreme
 ends of the spectrum here.
 I think most people actually would, if they could find a way, like to embrace the more
 centrist position.
 The trouble is that if you put your head above the parapet, you get it blown off by both
 sides.
 Right.
 And that is, it's difficult.
 It's actually, I speak about this a bit in the book.
 One of the forms of generosity that I think is most important for the era that we're in
 is bridging.
 It's the ability to unwillingness to listen to people from the other tribe with respect
 and to try to understand them and to be willing to try to find language, you know, that can
 find common ground.
 If we don't find people who are willing to do that were screwed.
 And so I think it's actually one of the most important forms of generosity that there
 is.
 There's a tale of the story in the book of the South African-American, Daryl Davis, who
 was puzzled why people hated him because of his skin color, you know, invited the local
 leader of the Ku Klux Klan to a meeting, ended up forming a relationship with them.
 He went to KKK rallies and they built it, they built, they somehow built a friendship.
 And this guy eventually left the KKK and his story, you know, became widely reported
 and inspired many others.
 I mean, people like him, I think, are rare, modern heroes that we need so, so many more
 of.
 And it's just a very hard space to be in.
 I'm doing a terrible job of trying to be in that space, but I'm absolutely determined
 to try and be in that space for Ted.
 We're going to get it wrong a lot of the time.
 We're going to be laughed at by people on both sides.
 But that's okay because we have to be there.
 Ideas are supposed to be able to leap from one tribe to another.
 That's the whole reason they're powerful.
 And if we give up that connectivity, we're giving up one of humanity's most important
 superpowers.
 Yeah, well, I applaud your efforts to continue that conversation and I encourage you to keep
 at it despite the pain it may cause you because this is an enormous problem which is making
 so many other political impasses in our society just impossible to navigate.
 I just, it touches everything and as we just saw it, touches the immediate response to
 the war in the Middle East and the repute or disrepute with which are most important
 academic institutions are held and it's just touching everything.
 And to my eye, many people are just very confused about the ethics and politics here
 and there's some low hanging fruit in terms of right answers that we can get our hands
 around and I happen to think Coleman is in possession of at least one there, but we're
 not going to resolve it here and I want to bend this conversation back to something
 that I know is closer to your heart at the moment, which is the topic of your book.
 Generosity, how do you think about generosity at this point and how has the internet changed
 your thinking?
 Yeah, so there's two pieces really that came together for this.
 One is just the science of generosity, I think is actually really, really interesting.
 My background was religious and one thing that kept me in the church for a long time was
 the belief that there was no basis for generosity or kindness or goodness or altruism outside
 a belief in God.
 I thought that outside that what you had was an evolved animal, you know, that was evolved
 to survive and that there was no basis for conscience or for being kind to others and
 it was the most thrilling discovery to realize that actually it was possible for selfish
 genes to evolve unselfish people, to build unselfish people and that unselfishness was
 actually a brilliant way of surviving if it could spread across a species and there's
 scientific arguments about whether that was a group selection thing or individual society,
 you know, how quite how that worked.
 But the fact is that humans along with several other species have developed this as a kind
 of superpower and it's that that has enabled basically everything that we've done by being
 the cooperating species that learned to, for example, you know, share bounty of hunting
 or whatever back in the day and learned mechanisms for trust and belief in each other.
 It's that that I think is at the heart of everything that we have built.
 It's the heart of civilization.
 So that's one piece that's cool.
 A second piece that is again, you know, biological is new evidence around just how wide we are
 to respond to generosity.
 You know, I got this ringside view of a crazy experiment called a mystery experiment where
 200 people on the internet were given $10,000 out of the blue, told no strings attached.
 You just have to tell us what you spend it on.
 And they ended up spending two thirds of that money generously.
 Like, this is not, you know, what sort of the rational agent theory of economics would
 predict, I think.
 And to be clear, this is 200 people getting $10,000 each.
 So $2 million.
 Yeah, that's right.
 And I had the chance to speak with them after this experiment was done.
 So the experiment was done in partnership with Elizabeth Darnett, the University of
 British Columbia.
 They published on it, you know, it's the biggest experiment of this kind of, you know, past
 experiments were done in the eye where, like, psychology students were given 20 bucks and
 yeah, they tended to be generous with that.
 But the fact that this held across seven countries and different income levels and so
 forth, really surprising and kind of wonderful.
 It shows that there is this mechanism in there whereby ripple effects can happen from
 generosity.
 There's a third biological piece that is the feeling we get when we see other people
 being generous.
 There's a sort of feeling of uplift that also increases levels of generosity.
 So put those things together with the fact that we're in this connected age now.
 And it's actually much easier to give away things that are hugely valuable to people
 at unlimited scale.
 So those ingredients in principle create a sort of playbook whereby acts of generosity
 could absolutely send ripples across the world in a great way.
 You've discovered this, by the way, in your own work here on this podcast, like you used
 to write books and sell them and so forth.
 Then you took a risk at some point and put all your time and effort into, you know, giving
 what I mean, people can support your podcast, but you could also give it away.
 And what you discovered was that your impact on the world increased by at least an order
 of magnitude, I think.
 And I think, you know, okay, is that self-promotion or is that generosity?
 Well, it's both.
 And I think both are there.
 And I think your willingness to spend all this time, you know, offering reason and insight
 to so many people, I view that as a fantastic gift to the world.
 That was not possible a couple of decades ago.
 And it's amazing that we're in a world where that can happen, where from your mind we
 can get all this stuff and I can listen to you every week or whatever.
 I think that's incredible.
 There are so many examples of this under the radar that I think it's worth putting a label
 on it and trying to imagine how we tweak it and dial it up.
 And so the label I put on it is infectious generosity.
 And I think there's a pathway where it can allow us to reclaim the internet, to being
 a force for good in the world and giving us at least a shot at a more hopeful future.
 We could talk about the various digital business models here and how they interact with this
 concept of generosity, because it's, you know, I have had a fairly unique experience
 here and so I'm happy to get into that if it's of interest.
 But to your first point about the common misunderstanding of our biological selfishness,
 the phrase the selfish gene, which, you know, almost an afterthought, I mean, Dawkins could
 have named it the immortal gene or the eternal gene, I forget which he, I think the immortal
 gene was what he was, he named it.
 But it doesn't mean that we're not capable of altruism, obviously, or selflessness even
 and self-sacrifice and there's a evolutionary rationale for why we would be from the genes
 I view, I mean, you know, kin selection and other properties of biology there.
 But there's, on the psychological side, there's just this fact which you point to that generosity
 and even classic, you know, selflessness just feels good, right, which is to say that caring
 about others is a very good strategy for caring about yourself, right?
 And so this opposition between selfishness and selflessness is fairly spurious.
 I mean, certainly as you climb the hierarchy of needs towards something like self-actualization,
 your actualization entails this capacity to genuinely care about other people and to
 genuinely love them and feel rewarded by your moral concern for them.
 And so there is just this thing that we might call, you know, wise selfishness which contains
 all of the prosocial and even self-sacrificing attitudes and norms that we would want it
 to and which are traditionally celebrated and championed under the banner of one or another
 religion.
 I mean, Buddhism is very articulate on this but, you know, as is Christianity.
 And yet this is not biologically mysterious and it's not psychologically mysterious and
 yet many people have drawn the opposite lesson that not only is selflessness and altruism
 and self-sacrifice, not only are those false norms, they're basically illusions, right?
 If you prick any one of those balloons, what you find in the middle of it is just pretension,
 you know, as I said at the top, just people are virtue signaling, they're just, this
 is another way of being self-regarding.
 And you touch this a little bit in your book where you deal with the Kantian notion of the
 purity of one's motives with respect to generosity and then the necessity that they not be mixed
 with any desire on one's own part to feel better, to be better, to burnish one's reputation.
 How do you think about the mixture of motives that can inspire giving and this notion, what
 I think you and I are going to agree is that this false ideal of a moral purity that comes
 from Kant and elsewhere.
 I mean, there's also the Christian notion here where, you know, you shouldn't be calling
 attention to your acts of piety or your acts of generosity, therefore the best form of
 giving I think many people and at least in our society believe is almost by definition
 anonymous.
 If you're giving anonymously, well, then we know it's pure, but if you're giving in a
 way that calls attention to the giving, well, then there has to be a mixture of motive.
 But in my view, you actually can do much more good when you are candid about how important
 philanthropy is to you and how rewarding it is to you and how consequential it is in
 the world.
 Would you just give me your take on all that?
 I think there's a simple mental shift that we all need to make, which is instead of looking
 for the bad in each other's motives to look for the good.
 You know, as a philosophy student, I literally would lie on the floor of my room for hours
 at a time trying to figure this one out because the notion of, like I wanted to be a good
 person, but to be good without external motivation, to be purely good, I couldn't see how that
 happened.
 Like even if you were just trying to obey the call of conscience, wasn't it true that
 obeying the call of conscience in a sense felt good?
 And so it wasn't that therefore in a way selfish.
 And so I think the truth, the truth is that generosity has always been, people have always
 done it for a reason and there's always been a little bit of selfishness in the mix.
 Now the amount of selfishness may vary in different people, but is it really, like if
 someone does something knowing secretly that it is in their long-term self-interest that
 if they do this, they're going to feel deeply happy at the end of the day or that it may
 actually enhance their reputation in the world, is that a bad thing?
 No, it's not.
 We should embrace it.
 And so I think that one of the core things I argue for here is that we have to let go
 of this idea of perfect generosity.
 It never was perfect.
 And in the modern era, there are actually more reasons than ever to look at the effects
 of generosity.
 Diversity is actually an amazing strategy for any person, any organization, any company.
 You give away stuff and incredible things can happen as a result.
 It can boost your reputation.
 I think rather than criticizing people for that, we should celebrate it because we want
 more of that.
 We don't want less of that.
 We want more of that.
 And so the simple shift of saying, just stop this ridiculous cynicism about someone's motives
 or trying to double guess, is someone gives away money?
 Were they really doing this actually to enhance their reputation?
 That's not a bad thing.
 It's good.
 It's good that they gave away the money for a good course, celebrate it and give other
 people permission to do it.
 Doing that?
 Just that simple shift would unlock so much extra kindness because I think a lot of people
 are fearful of doing it or certainly fearful of saying anything for precisely the reason
 that they're going to get shot at.
 It's crazy.
 It's really crazy.
 We've got to get past that and look at the world more realistically and then just connected
 to that.
 You said it was sort of obvious in a way that giving can be good for you, can make you happy
 and so forth.
 I actually think for a lot of people, it's actually not that obvious.
 I think that the psychology around this is really quite confusing to me and quite weird
 because it's true that there are indelible, profound links between generosity and happiness.
 But I think they're often hidden and in the moment when we're thinking about being generous,
 what we're actually also aware of is the fear of loss and a loss aversion is a really
 powerful thing and it's entirely possible for someone to go through a month without really
 thinking about opportunities to be kind because life is hard and you're focused on our work
 or we're focused on how to get the next paycheck in or whatever it is.
 Those feelings are much more pressing, shall we say.
 I think part of the playbook here, part of the life hack, if you like, is to remind ourselves
 that actually if you take a gamble on being generous, you actually may not feel it with
 any certainty in the moment, but you can be pretty sure that afterwards you'll get payback.
 There will be a feeling of fulfilment and even if there's no payback if you like from
 the people you gave things to, which there may be that as well, there will be payback
 and just, you know, that sort of feeling of, ah, I can be that person.
 Everyone at some level wants to be their better self, I think.
 Yeah, I think we perhaps should linger on this point of the difference between intentions
 and results.
 I guess there's a third factor here which we haven't named, what we've already mentioned,
 which is there's just the way we feel as a result of giving.
 So I think intentions and reward from giving and results are all separable and they all
 matter, but they matter differently.
 I think it's important to optimise for all of them and just to be aware of the trade-offs
 here.
 And this is one of the things that I, really the main thing that I've found so valuable
 in effective altruism.
 I haven't, and we'll talk about the bad odor that surrounds this phrase now as a result
 of Sam Bagman Freed.
 But I've never formally considered myself an effective altruist because it's always
 seemed a little too online and a little too cultic and a little too shot through with
 Asperger's or something.
 But I've talked to the principal founders of it, Will McCaskill and Toby Ward and Peter
 Singer as well and admire those guys immensely.
 And the real contributions made to my own life is to differentiate these factors so that
 I can recognise that the reward I get from giving is separable from the results and there
 are certain, there are certain things I can give to where the results in the world are
 as good as they could possibly be, but it's just not that sexy a cause and I don't find
 it that interesting or rewarding frankly.
 It's just not, it's not the thing that really tugs at my heartstrings.
 And so what I've decided to do is just optimise for results in so far as that I can do that
 through people advising me and doing research and then consider the good feels and the search
 for good feels to be an additional project that is, it's almost like a guilty pleasure.
 So I decided, I took their 10% pledge then to give 10% of all pre-tax dollars to the
 most effective charities and so I do that, but then I give more than that and I consider
 that those gifts to the one person with a GoFundMe who has some truly tragic story that wouldn't
 survive an EA analysis, but it's something that I really want to do and the beautiful
 thing is that it has made it even more rewarding to do those things, like it's truly, it's
 almost like a noble form of greed that gets satisfied by helping people in those specific
 ways that fall outside of the optimised results analysis that come from an EA perspective.
 And then finally intentions matter, simply apart from the way in which they colour our
 minds moment to moment and really dictate who we are in relation to other people, they
 matter just because if someone's giving to a cause simply to burnish the reputation,
 that's all they care about and they don't really care about alleviating human suffering
 or doing any other good in the world, well then if that's what they care about, you can
 predict in the future that they are going to go, they're going to be blown around by
 whatever incentives aim at burnishing their reputation and they're not going to be reliable
 partners in the project of reducing human suffering because that's not what they care
 about, so that's why intention matters but I just think we can keep all of those specific
 dials in view and tune them as correctly as we can so as to have both the best possible
 personal experience and also do the most good in the world.
 Yeah, so there's a lot there, I agree with you on the intention side, if you knew for
 certain sure that the only reason someone was doing something that looks generous was
 to burnish their reputation, then that doesn't really count as generosity but we actually
 never know that, it achieves good, if some sociopath is going to give you $100 million
 to build a hospital, it's still, you still get a hospital but I don't think you have
 to describe that as generosity but I think the truth is that in almost every circumstance
 we don't know, I think people's intentions are almost always mixed, I think most people,
 their main focus is the giving away of the money and the hope that it will do something
 and they're happy that their reputation may benefit as well but it's not, it may not be
 the main driver, the point is from the outside you don't know and therefore what business
 do we have to take the cynical view, I think it's really important just to look for the
 good in the intention rather than the bad but in terms of you know what you were saying
 about, there's this really important dance I think between our generous instincts and
 our reasoned response to those instincts, I think the reason part is really important,
 traditionally people often, when they give, it is on impulse, you see there's some tragedy
 in the world and you think oh I must, you know, text in my contribution or whatever and that
 feels good or we just, you know, we feel great empathy for someone close to us and they have
 a need and we'll support that, Paul Bloom you know wrote this book Against Empathy which
 was kind of trying to argue that too much of that is not, you know, doesn't get us where
 we need to go because there are so many resources in the world, it actually really is important
 that we spend them wisely and so I think there's a really important dance that each
 of us has to do which is to try to bring our reason to bear and to say okay I care about
 this, I care about this, stop, don't write a check right away, just think for a minute
 what is the most effective thing you can do and that you know, so go to effective altruism
 if you just ask the question do we want our altruism to be effective, well yes I think
 we do, you know, we'd like it to be smart, we'd like it to be reason based, we'd like
 the money to be spent wisely and that's why I'm with you on, you know, I've got huge respect
 for people like Wilma Cascore and the other founders of effective altruism, I think if
 you view it as a journey and I think Will would say this now about it, it's not any
 individual recommendation they make at any point in time is provisional, what they're
 anchored in is the desire to figure out what is a wise way to give and when you put it
 that way that is absolutely the right question to ask, what is a wise way because it's not
 obvious, there are so many, you know, there's orders of magnitude difference between spending
 money smartly and spending it stupidly and I think, you know, I talk a lot in the book
 about trying to find the leverage point, when you spend money you're looking for what is
 it that makes this a good value for money, you know, can you leverage technology, can
 you leverage government policy, can you leverage the internet, can you leverage education and
 knowledge and I think when you find something that really where you get, wow, that organization
 is being really smart about how they're spending their money, it's very exciting to do it
 and I agree with you that it doesn't have the immediate feels of, you know, here's a
 family in need, you write them a check, they cry, you cry, lovely, but there is actually
 something satisfying deeply I think about taking the time to have a plan and to know
 to think about what you can afford to spend, to commit to spending it and to getting it
 to a point where you feel good about it, I think really makes makes you feel different,
 I mean, I know, you know, I had a foundation and for years I was, I couldn't figure out
 what to spend the money on that got me excited, coming to TED, I suddenly found, wow, okay,
 I get this, I'm leveraging the power of ideas, I love that, I love that and it didn't give
 me the kind of, here's a family crying and I can do something about it, it kind of feels
 but it gave me a different kind of satisfaction to have found what was for me the right way
 of spending the foundation's money.
 So I, thus the dance I think is start with, start with the biological instinct and the
 sort of the realization that for you to feel good about yourself, you know, generosity
 should be part of who you are, but then take the time to think it through and figure it
 out.
 What is the wise way to go?
 Because there are just such different answers to that.
 Well, let's talk about business models because I have a fairly unique one at which you eluded
 and it might be slightly different than you imagined and also you at TED have a fairly
 unique one and there are actually some similarities between the two and I just would love to get
 your take on this.
 So originally on the podcast I had the, kind of the NPR, PBS, Patreon style business where
 it was, you know, it was free for everyone to listen to it, people expect podcasts to
 be free and I didn't, you know, for a variety of reasons, I didn't want to take ads.
 So I just said, you know, if you enjoy what is happening over here, you can support it
 and here's how and I think I was, I was very successful in doing that and it was, it was
 a, you know, a real business and, and it was quite stable and I had about probably two years
 of running it that way where it was just, I mean, the, the income was perfectly reliable.
 I mean, maybe it moved around by two or three percent on any given month, but it just, it
 seemed completely, I had found what, I had found the floor and the ceiling and it was
 just, it was just humming along and nothing seemed broken about it except for two things.
 One, I released my meditation app alongside this podcast and that was structured differently.
 That was an app in the app store and it was pay walled.
 I mean, it was, you could use it for free for some time, but then you, then you had to
 subscribe and if you couldn't afford it, you could just send an email and we would give
 it to you for free and that's still the case and it's, it's still the case on this podcast,
 but I had these two experiments, you know, in business running side by side.
 One had a pay wall and one was sort of opt out and one was opt in, right?
 And it was really just, you know, mp3 files on both platforms and I noticed that by comparison
 with the app, the podcast business was broken and I didn't do anything about it until I,
 I stumbled upon a conversation on Reddit which truly bold me over and I think you might find
 this interesting because this, this revealed to me that as a business model, there's something
 wrong with the spirit of generosity and the spirit of philanthropy because I spectated
 upon this.
 So the thread was something around, you know, do you support Sam's podcast and if so, why
 or why not and someone said, well, I would support the podcast if I knew what he was
 going to do with the money and another person said, well, I would support the podcast if
 I knew how much it costs to run a podcast and another person said, you know, I would
 support the podcast if I knew how much I thought a person should earn from a podcast, right?
 And I looked at those three statements and I mean, my head practically fell off my shoulders
 because I realized at a glance there was something deeply wrong here because these are the kinds
 of considerations that would never have occurred to a person when they were thinking about buying
 my next book, for instance.
 I mean, there's literally no person on earth who's ever thought the thought, well, I would
 buy his next book if I knew how much I thought an author should make from writing books or
 I would buy his next book if I knew what he was going to do with the money, right?
 I mean, these are just not the kinds of thoughts people think, either you want to read the
 book or you don't and you buy it or not.
 And so I decided to make the podcast emulate the app in that I made the paywall compulsory
 in that, you know, it's now paywall then you if you're not behind the paywall, you're
 only hearing the first part of every podcast.
 But if you can't afford it, you just have to send an email and we give it to you for
 free, right?
 And I staff literally full time, something like 30 or 35 people in the customer service
 and 95% of what they do is just minister to free accounts.
 And there were days during COVID where a thousand people would send that email a day, right?
 And, you know, many hundreds send that email on any given day for the app or the podcast
 or both.
 And that's fine.
 So I'm very committed to money never being the reason why someone can't get access to what
 I'm doing, because it's important that that not be the reason and it being a digital product,
 you know, allows for that.
 But the crucial thing to realize here is that when I changed the paywall on the podcast,
 first of all, when I announced that I was going to do this, many people predicted that
 it was going to be a disaster that I, you know, that my audience would shrink to nothing
 and that no one would pay because everyone expects podcast to be free, unlike apps, everyone
 expects podcast to be free.
 You know, most of them are, most of them are ad supported.

 With midterm elections in just two days,
 America is in a very angry moment.
 Republicans attack Democrats, and Democrats return fire.
 Social media is a showcase of our anger,
 an analysis by the New York Times this fall
 found that online use of the phrase ""civil war""
 has exploded.
 Now, leading voices in academia and tech
 are saying that rather than simply reflecting
 the polarization in society,
 platforms like Facebook and Twitter
 are helping to create it.
 60 Minutes first met Tristan Harris in 2017.
 The co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology
 argued that social media platforms
 were addicting us to maximize profit.
 Now he's warning, they are generating billions
 by making us angry.
 - The more moral outrageous language you use,
 the more inflammatory language contemptuous language,
 the more indignation you use,
 the more it will get shared.
 So, we are being rewarded for being division entrepreneurs.
 The better you are at innovating a new way to be divisive,
 we will pay you in more likes, followers and retweets.
 - In his 2020 documentary, The Social Dilemma,
 Tristan Harris made the case that social media platforms
 have hijacked our attention.
 Now he cites a new study of Twitter
 showing that attacking political opponents
 is almost guaranteed to draw attention.
 - Each individual term, referring to your political outgroup,
 increased the odds of that post being retweeted
 or re-shared by 67%.
 - Your outgroup being opponents,
 people on the other side, yeah, exactly.
 - These platforms, are they not just reflecting who we are
 and what we think and the divisions that are already there?
 - They're supercharging a hundred or a thousand times to one,
 the worst parts of ourselves.
 - Here's an example from the day the Department of Justice
 released a photo showing classified documents
 in former President Donald Trump's Florida home,
 a tweet highlighting a straight news story on the subject
 received about 2,000 likes.
 But a tweet from a Republican congresswoman
 calling Trump's opponents dumbasses
 was liked 10 times as much.
 And a tweet from the left
 labeling Donald Trump a traitor was liked 20 times more.
 - The straight news story, you know,
 got retweeted a couple of times.
 - Right.
 - Angry stories, exponentially more.
 - Exactly, exactly.
 - And Harris says,
 ""Angers skews the political landscape.""
 - Why is it that the world knows more
 about Marjorie Taylor Greene
 than they know about all the other hundreds
 of congressional candidates?
 It's because the enraging inflammatory stuff
 goes the most viral.
 - We are tribal creatures who love to do us versus them
 and we're now learning to coexist with the technology
 that tries to force that down our throat,
 that tries to make us angry all the time.
 - Jonathan Heit is a social psychologist
 and professor at NYU Stern School of Business.
 In studying social media platforms drive
 to keep us glued to our devices and to their ads,
 he traces our current troubles
 to the invention of the like, share,
 and retweet features a decade ago.
 - These changes in the technology
 that made everything much more viral and explosive,
 it says though it gave everybody a dark gun.
 It's like it gave everybody the ability
 to complain, attack, criticize anyone at any time
 in a very short space with no need for evidence,
 no accountability.
 - Heit says, ""The people most likely
 to fire their social media dark guns
 are those on the far right and the far left.""
 - What percentage of the population are they?
 - It's about seven or eight percent on each side.
 - That's it.
 - Yeah, that's right.
 - So the extremes have been handed the power to dominate,
 even though they are fewer in number.
 - That's right, exactly.
 - The moderate majority Heit says
 is either exhausted or intimidated.
 - It's what I call structural stupidity.
 That is, you have very smart people,
 highly educated, highly intelligent,
 but you put them in a situation
 in which dissent is punished severely in what happens.
 They go silent.
 And when the moderates or when anyone is afraid
 to question the dominant view,
 the organization, the institution gets stupid.
 - Take the case of Ronald Sullivan,
 a professor at Harvard Law School
 who was also the faculty dean of Winthrop House
 and undergraduate residence hall.
 In January 2019, Sullivan joined Harvey Weinstein's
 sexual assault defense team
 under the principle that every accused criminal
 is entitled to a robust defense.
 - So at Harvard, some students object it.
 Now, great, let them object to Ron Sullivan
 defending Harvey Weinstein.
 That's what you should do in school.
 You should make an argument.
 And then he can answer back.
 That would be great, but that's not what happened.
 - What happened was that a Harvard undergrad
 demanded in a Facebook post
 that Sullivan stepped down as dean,
 calling his defense of Weinstein
 deeply trauma inducing for sexual assault victims.
 - The students use a discourse, a dialogue,
 of he is dangerous.
 His presence near me is threatening to me.
 - Within a few months, Harvard responded
 by removing Sullivan as dean of the residence hall.
 It's not just professors on the firing line.
 In a recent survey, more than half of college students
 said they're afraid to express views on political
 and social issues in the classroom.
 - As a professor, what do you do?
 - I just avoid controversial topics.
 - Really? - Yes.
 - Isn't that what college is for?
 - It used to be.
 - Tristan Harris says the intimidation and anger
 cut across political lines.
 - I think the deepest, like perverse thing
 about these platforms is that they have captured
 the meaning of social participation in society,
 that they've colonized and privatized,
 that social participation means I'm on TikTok,
 I'm on Instagram, I'm on Facebook.
 - And competition is fierce among those platforms
 for our attention and for the advertising dollars
 that attention generates.
 - Facebook isn't saying, let me make design decisions
 that are gonna strengthen democracy.
 They're saying, how do I evolve the product
 in a direction that will get more engagement from people?
 'Cause if I don't do that,
 I'm just gonna lose to the companies that do.
 - Companies like TikTok.
 - Companies like TikTok.
 And TikTok has become like one of the most popular apps
 around the entire world.
 - TikTok has done that by serving up
 an addictive mix of short videos.
 Some are silly.
 Others overtly political.
 It's owned by a Chinese company called ByteDance.
 And Harris says the version that's served
 to Chinese consumers called doyeng
 is very different from the one available in the West.
 - In their version of TikTok,
 if you're under 14 years old,
 they show you science experiments you can do at home,
 museum exhibits, patriotism videos,
 and educational videos.
 And they also limit it to only 40 minutes per day.
 Now, they don't ship that version of TikTok
 to the rest of the world.
 So it's almost like they recognize
 that technology's influencing kids development,
 and they make their domestic version,
 a spinach version of TikTok,
 while they ship the opium version
 to the rest of the world.
 - The version served to the West
 has kids hooked for hours at a time.
 The impact Harris says is predictable.
 - There's a survey of pre-teens in the US and China
 asking, what is the most aspirational career
 that you want to have?
 And the US, the number one was influencer.
 - Social media influencer.
 - And in China, the number one was astronaut.
 Again, you allow those two societies to play out
 for a few generations.
 I can tell you what your world is gonna look like.
 TikTok tells us it gives American users tools
 to limit screen time.
 But those tools are entirely voluntary.
 And national security concerns have triggered new calls
 this past week for TikTok to be banned in the US.
 Twitter points out that it asks users to think twice
 before sharing potentially harmful posts.
 But within days of buying Twitter,
 Elon Musk tweeted a conspiracy theory
 about the attack on speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband.
 It was later deleted.
 And Facebook says it has cut the overall amount
 of political content that its 240 million American users see.
 Monica Bicard is its head of content policy.
 - Most people on Facebook don't want to see political content.
 They are following what's happening in the lives
 of their family and friends
 and sharing the moments from their lives.
 - And Bicard says Facebook does take steps
 to downplay the angriest posts.
 - Can you find angry political content online?
 You can.
 Can you walk into the average family's Thanksgiving dinner
 and hear people having an angry political conversation?
 You can.
 - Tristan Harris says that all the social media platforms
 are making those conversations even more heated.
 - What I think there's been a failure to recognize
 is the direct conflict between an engagement
 for profit business model and what's good for democracy.
 Another way you can say it is that the business model
 is to ruin Thanksgiving dinner.
 - We are as divided as I can remember in my lifetime.
 - Yeah.
 A lot of people will say, well, hold on a second.
 Partisanship and division,
 we've had that in many times throughout history.
 - Always. - Always.
 That's true.
 Also has partisanship in television and radio
 pre-existed social media.
 Yes, have we ever wired up the most powerful
 artificial intelligence in the world
 pointed at your brainstem to show you
 the most enraging content on a daily basis
 and the longer you scroll, the more you get?
 We have never done that before.
 - Facebook's Monica Bicard insists it's just wrong
 to blame it for America's anger.
 - Also, if we look at who's becoming more polarized
 in the United States, the greatest increase is among
 people over the age of 65.
 And they are the least likely to be using social media.
 - Many people watching us will say,
 ""Well, I don't use social media.
 Why should I care about this?""
 But we're all downstream from social media affecting television,
 affecting radio, affecting journalism.
 More and more of journalism is about covering
 the outrage exchange of what happened on Twitter.
 - Harris believes the best path to reform
 would be stricter government regulation
 of social media platforms, or at least a requirement
 that they be more transparent.
 - Facebook will tell you that they're all
 about transparency now, that's not convincing.
 - They publish reports that they define what the metrics are
 and it's like grading your own homework.
 - Harris has launched an online course
 which aims to give people working in tech
 the tools to push for reform from within
 and what can an individual user do.
 Jonathan Heitz says, simply refuse to be gladiators
 in the Colosseum of social media.
 - You can't win a war on social media.
 Just don't engage.
 Don't engage in the public battles
 because that's just feeding the beast.
 - You don't mean disengage from the political process.
 You mean just disengage from these platforms?
 - Yes, when public discourse was moved
 into the middle of the Roman Colosseum,
 I'm saying disengage from that.
 Walk out of the Colosseum and still be politically active.
 - Tristan Harris says real change
 may have to be forced in court.
 - I think we have to do with social media
 what happened with Big Tobacco.
 - What stopped Big Tobacco was that the attorneys general
 in different states actually went after them.
 - The attorneys general in Big Tobacco
 had an enormous role to play
 in litigating that there was harms to people
 and their families.
 - Is that what it's gonna take with social media?
 - I think that's what's gonna take with social media.
 - Social media companies, yes.
 And we're seeing attorneys general
 move already one step in that direction.
 - Attorneys general in at least eight states
 are coordinating a nationwide investigation
 of social media platforms.
 - We now know that there's all these harms
 in social media products designed for engagement.
 We've done it before.
 We did it with seat belts.
 We've done it with Big Tobacco.
 We've taken lead out of gasoline.
 - We have made these changes once we recognize
 that certain products were toxic for us.
 We can do it again.
 (clock ticking)
 - It's the vote that holds America together.
 Belief that with a ballot, voices are heard,
 disputes are addressed and there's always another chance.
 Countries without this belief tend to be in bondage,
 or at war.
 Election day is coming, but across America,
 belief is under attack.
 Politicians who say the 2020 election was stolen
 are running for governor in 19 states,
 attorney general in 10.
 And in 12 states, election deniers are running
 for secretary of state, which would give them power
 over elections.
 After two years of investigations and audits,
 no fraud or error has been found in any state
 that would change the 2020 outcome.
 But in 2022, spreading doubt has been key
 to an endorsement from Donald Trump.
 No state has been more deeply driven by this
 than Arizona, where a split in the GOP
 has Republicans on opposite sides of a grand canyon.
 On one side of the Arizona chasm stands Rusty Bowers,
 a lifelong Republican and artist who became
 Arizona's Speaker of the House.
 Bowers told us he was disappointed when Joe Biden won.
 So when President Trump and Rudy Giuliani
 called after the election, he was listening.
 - First Rudy started, he said,
 well, there's been a lot of fraud all across the country.
 And in Arizona, and then he listed off large numbers
 in categories that would be illegal,
 dead people, stolen ballots.
 - Bowers says Giuliani wanted him to hold a vote
 to revoke Biden's electors.
 And I said, but Rudy, I want the proof.
 You're gonna give me the proof?
 And he said, yes.
 - So Giuliani and co-counsel Jenna Ellis
 flew out to meet Bowers.
 - You left the meeting with Rudy Giuliani thinking, what?
 - I wasn't happy.
 I said, okay, time out.
 Mr. Giuliani, you said you were going to bring me some proof.
 Names, et cetera, of all of these people.
 Did you bring me the proof?
 You looked at Jenna Ellis and he said,
 do we have the proof?
 And she said, yes, we do.
 Do you have it with you?
 No, no, I, where is it?
 Well, it might be back at the hotel room.
 And I said, I asked you for the proof.
 You said you'd bring it.
 You're not bringing it.
 You're asking me to break my oath
 and make up something to pull electors
 and replace electors,
 which has never been done in the history of the United States.
 And I'm gonna try that on my state.
 - Without Bowers, Giuliani found an ally
 willing to call the vote criminal.
 Arizona State Representative Mark Fincham.
 - It's exceedingly hard for me to place a label
 on what we've heard other than racketeering.
 Good old fashioned mobster racketeering.
 We're caught between the four weeks
 after Mr. Trump's defeat,
 Fincham held an unofficial hearing featuring Giuliani.
 - A conspiracy that was hatched
 by the crooked leaders of the Democratic Party.
 A day of allegations without credible evidence
 ended with this.
 - When Satan wants to extinguish a light,
 he will stop at nothing.
 So, be on your guard, put on the full armor of God,
 and be prepared to fight.
 - Mark Fincham fought.
 And now the 65-year-old former police officer
 is the Republican nominee for Arizona Secretary of State,
 which would give him authority over elections.
 - Ladies and gentlemen, we know it,
 and they know it.
 Donald Trump won.
 - But Mark Bernovich does not know it.
 He's Arizona's Republican Attorney General,
 who's investigated for two years
 and has a word for claims of fraud.
 - Horse (beep)
 And that's what it is.
 Most of its horse (beep)
 and I've been trying to scrape it off my shoes
 for the last year.
 - Bernovich supported Trump,
 who called him with advice.
 - He goes, all you gotta do is say the election's fraudulent
 and you will be a superstar.
 You'll be the most popular guy in America.
 And I told him, I said, ""Mr. President,
 I didn't become Attorney General to be a star.
 I brought my star with me.
 And I don't need anybody,
 whether it's a former president or any other person
 validating what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.""
 - What he's doing is bringing indictments
 in every 2020 vote fraud case
 that he can back with evidence.
 All together to date from the general election,
 Arizona has indicted 12 defendants
 in cases involving a total of 12 ballots, 12 statewide.
 Biden won Arizona by 10,000.
 There was no one in this country
 that wanted to find evidence of fraud more than I did,
 but I thought it was important to systematically
 go through and say, ""No, this is the facts.
 This is the evidence.
 Everyone's entitled to their own opinions.""
 But when you're an actual prosecutor,
 when you're the actual government,
 there's a higher obligation.
 You can't afford to be sloppy.
 - In addition to Bernovich's investigations,
 in 2021, the Republican-led State Senate
 audited Phoenix's Maricopa County, home to 60%
 of the state vote.
 The audit was done by a company
 that had never audited an election.
 The audit's hand recount confirmed Joe Biden won,
 but its report also raised questions
 about discrepancies it found.
 Those questions were answered online in detail
 by Maricopa County.
 Still, widespread fraud is Mark Fincham's charge.
 - When you steal something, that's not really a win.
 That's a fraud.
 - That was in Washington the day before the attack
 on the Capitol, which Fincham describes this way.
 - This entire J6 crap was manufactured
 to create a narrative that there was an assault
 on the Capitol.
 This fits into the Marxist ideology
 of how do you go to one party rule?
 - Today, Fincham is running neck and neck
 with his Democratic opponent, Adrian Fontes,
 who helped lead the 2020 election in Maricopa County.
 - We are far too divided away from each other
 based on lies and conspiracies.
 And we as election administrators across Arizona
 have to do a better job showing folks
 that the system is quite good.
 - I'd like to see a world where it's easy to vote,
 but hard to cheat.
 - We asked Fincham for credible proof of fraud.
 He raised not evidence, but those questions
 from the state Senate audit.
 Next, Fincham told us about a mysterious
 post-election email, which he featured in a rally.
 - We have a whistleblower who sent an email
 not just to the DOJ, but to every single legislator saying,
 there's 34, 35,000 fictitious voters
 and they've been in a certain system where you'll never find them.
 Well, we believe we found them.
 (crowd cheering)
 - In the email, Fincham speaks of.
 A Brian Watson said Democrats added bogus votes
 electronically in Pima County.
 The writer had no evidence asked not to be contacted
 and closed his email account.
 - Why would you give this any credence?
 - Again, it's an open question.
 I want to know, was there a possibility that this happened?
 Now, we've now proven that it happens, Scott.
 - How so?
 - We've got two precincts that show over 100%
 of the people registered to vote in that precinct voted.
 That is an undeniable fact.
 - But it is deniable by Pima County,
 which says no precinct had more votes than voters.
 Another of Fincham's frequent points concerns
 a pair of indictments.
 - We have, for example, in Yuma County,
 ballot harvesting and votes.
 I mean, we've got people who were indicted
 for the very thing that we're talking about right now,
 who pled guilty.
 And frankly, those votes altered the outcome of Yuma County.
 - Yuma County, we've actually had indictments
 and people that have pled guilty to ballot trafficking.
 - How many ballots were involved?
 - They don't know off the top of my head.
 - It's four, okay.
 Whether it's four or 4,000, it doesn't matter.
 - It wasn't the presidential election, it was a primary.
 - It doesn't matter.
 It's a defect in the system.
 - A miniscule defect.
 Two women in Yuma County pleaded guilty
 to collecting four ballots and dropping them in a ballot box.
 It's against state law to deposit a ballot
 that isn't yours or your families.
 - It's four ballots in a primary.
 - In that instance.
 - In that instance.
 - You have a bigger one?
 - Well, we've got information that's been turned
 over to the Attorney General's office
 and you say that there was nothing there, okay,
 then I'm gonna have to live with that.
 But do I know for a fact
 that there were other ballot trafficking operations
 around the country and some in Arizona?
 Yeah, I do.
 - Name one.
 - Yuma County, 25,000 ballots.
 - What happened?
 - Same fingerprints on those ballots for five individuals.
 - So where'd that go?
 Where's that evidence?
 I know it's been turned over to the Attorney General's office.
 I know that the FBI field office actually did the prints.
 - That's false, according to the FBI.
 Yuma County told us that no one
 in law enforcement fingerprinted 25,000 ballots.
 Fincham often says that evidence
 is with Attorney General Bernovich,
 implying that something big is coming.
 In fact, he has a mountain of evidence
 that's sitting in his office.
 - But Bernovich told us his investigation
 is essentially over.
 - We as prosecutors deal in facts and evidence.
 And I'm not like the clowns
 that throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks.
 - Clowns.
 - Clowns, did I say that?
 Yes, I think that there were a lot of clowns out there
 that they saw what they wanted to see.
 What is that, Simon Garfunkel line
 that a man hears what he wants to hear
 and disregards the rest.
 There was a lot of that going on.
 - It's going on in the top Arizona races
 where the Republican for governor is a denier.
 - We had a fraudulent election, a corrupt election,
 and we have an illegitimate president
 sitting in the White House.
 - It's like a giant grift in some ways.
 - A grift, a swindle is what you're saying.
 - Yes.
 - All of these accusations, the case in Yuma,
 scaremongering, the Brian Watson email,
 scaremongering, you called Arizona the epicenter of fraud.
 It's scaremongering.
 It's not the fraud that is breaking people's faith
 in our elections, it's people like you.
 - So you say,
 but when we look at the violations of state statute,
 this is the epicenter of the problem.
 Nationwide, 190 election deniers
 are running for the US House and 14 for the US Senate,
 according to the Brookings Institution.
 Mark Bernovich lost his primary to a denier,
 and so did Rusty Bowers, which may come as a relief.
 - Don't come over, don't come over.
 - Post-election Trump supporters and conspiracy spinners
 laid siege to Bowers' home, up to three times a week.
 - Rusty Bowers is a pedophile, you go home.
 - He had to fend them off, a man with a pistol,
 demonstrators in their own armored car.
 And at the state Capitol, on January 6, 2021,
 they came with rifles and a guillotine.
 In Arizona, when belief in the vote eroded,
 this is what filled the void.
 - Has the Republican Party
 that you've known all your life been hijacked?
 - It's a large group of them that is doing the hijacking.
 I just don't think it's a majority.
 It's effectiveness as a party,
 and it's legitimacy in public discourses
 is grossly undermined by how they've acted in this state.
 (clock ticking)
 It was just days after the 2020 presidential election
 that lawyers supporting then-President Donald Trump
 began spreading unsubstantiated claims
 that an American company, Dominion Voting Systems,
 had rigged the election.
 They said Dominion was backed by Venezuela,
 and that his machines and software
 switched millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.
 They never showed any evidence,
 but that didn't stop pro-Trump attorneys
 from making baseless claims
 or conservative news networks
 from giving them plenty of airtime.
 Dominion has filed eight lawsuits
 seeking more than $10 billion in damages against Fox News
 and other networks, corporations, and individuals.
 But Dominion CEO John Poulos has remained largely silent,
 until now.
 We spoke with him about the lawsuits, the lies,
 and the irreparable damage he says
 they've caused to his company and his employees.
 People have been put into danger.
 Their families have been put into danger.
 Their lives have been upended and all because of lies.
 It was a very clear calculation
 that they knew they were lies,
 and they were repeating them and endorsing them.
 It's important to you people admit what they said was wrong.
 It's important to me.
 It's important to all the people
 whose families have been impacted by this.
 Anderson, my kids still are not allowed
 to get any package from the front door
 until we verify that it's actually from a trusted sender.
 You're that concerned about somebody
 sending something to your house?
 It's not unfounded concern.
 People have done that.
 People have done this.
 People are warning that they will continue to do this.
 For John Poulos and his company,
 the trouble began five days after the election
 when Fox business host Maria Bartiromo
 brought up Dominion with attorney Sidney Powell.
 Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software.
 I know that there were voting irregularities.
 Tell me about that.
 That's to put it mildly.
 The computer glitches could not and should not have happened
 at all.
 That is where the fraud took place,
 where they were flipping votes in the computer system
 or adding votes that did not exist.
 Sidney Powell was never able to show fraud,
 but she was repeatedly invited back on Fox networks,
 as was the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani,
 who also wove a false narrative about Smartmatic,
 an election technology company,
 which is now suing Giuliani, Fox News and others.
 Smartmatic is a company that was formed
 by three Venezuelaans who were very close to the dictator
 Chavez of Venezuela.
 And it was formed in order to fix elections.
 That's the company that owns Dominion.
 Does Smartmatic own Dominion?
 No, we do have a relationship.
 We are competitors.
 Were you associated with the late Hugo Chavez?
 Absolutely not.
 Do you use a Venezuelan company's software
 that's been used to steal election out of the countries?
 Absolutely not.
 And I can cut all of this short.
 We were founded in Toronto,
 which is where my family was from,
 and there was nothing to do with Venezuela.
 Can you flip votes in the computer system?
 Can you add votes that did not exist?
 Absolutely not.
 President Trump first mentioned Dominion
 in a tweet November 12th,
 and recorded this video a few weeks later,
 which was posted on Facebook.
 We have a company that's very suspect.
 Its name is Dominion, with the turn of a dial,
 or the change of a chip.
 You can press a button for Trump,
 and the vote goes to Biden.
 What kind of a system is this?
 We have to go to paper.
 Maybe it takes longer.
 But the only secure system is paper.
 Why not just have paper ballots?
 We do have paper ballots.
 What the machines do is they count those paper ballots
 in a way that makes it very easy for people to verify
 after the fact through the means of audits and recounts.
 Dominion makes two types of machines.
 One is called a ballot marker.
 It's a touchscreen device that a voter can use
 to mark their choices and then print the ballot.
 The second machine is a scanner
 that reads that paper ballot, counts the vote,
 and immediately stores the ballot securely.
 A voter takes a paper ballot.
 They've made their marks, however they make their marks,
 depending on the jurisdiction.
 As they deposit it into the ballot box,
 it goes through a digital scanner,
 and then drops into the ballot box.
 So how do you hack a paper ballot?
 It goes through our system.
 He showed us how it works.
 This is the scanner that sits atop a locked and sealed ballot box.
 This is how they cast their ballot, goes through a scanner,
 and now we have an image of the ballot that we just cast,
 and we have the paper ballot that is used for recounts.
 John Poulow says it was watching the presidential recounts
 in Florida in 2000 with those arguments over hanging chads
 that got him interested in improving how paper ballots
 were marked and counted.
 He was an engineer working at a startup in Silicon Valley
 and began looking at ways to make it easier
 to recount paper ballots and to help people
 with disabilities vote without assistance.
 Our goal was to allow any voter to make their marks
 on a paper ballot in a very clear, unambiguous way,
 regardless of physical ability.
 John Poulow is Canadian and founded Dominion in 2002.
 He remains its chief executive, though it was acquired
 by an American investment group in 2018.
 Dominion is based in Denver.
 Do you ever think to yourself, I got into this
 to help paraplegics and blind people vote more easily
 and look at what's happened?
 I think about it all the time.
 Dominion is one of three companies
 that make most of the voting systems in America.
 In the 2020 presidential election,
 their machines were in 28 states, red states, and blue.
 On election day, in a precinct,
 are your machines hooked up to the internet?
 No, not by any stretch.
 We go through a number of certifications,
 government certifications,
 and the first one is at a federal level.
 So, both standards mandate that election systems,
 such as ours, are designed to work in a closed system,
 air gapped, no internet.
 In all the major swing states of 2020,
 there are paper ballots backing up--
 Not only are there paper ballots
 that make up the official record,
 those paper ballots have been hand-counted
 and audited over 1,000 times on just the 2020 election.
 Recounts and audits in the swing states of Georgia, Arizona,
 Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada
 all confirmed Dominion's results.
 More than 60 lawsuits around the country
 challenging the election by Trump
 or his supporters were ultimately withdrawn or failed.
 In Georgia, there have been three recounts,
 two electronic ones and one hand recount.
 In front of cameras, bipartisan poll watchers
 and thousands of local residents across the state of Georgia,
 and it once again reaffirmed the results.
 That should have put an end to all of it,
 but the lies persisted.
 And so have incidents of harassment and threats
 against John Poulos and his employees.
 Every single person at Dominion's going to end up
 at an orange jumpsuit in handcuffs.
 You (beep) the horse, you cheating (beep) tags.
 - Yeah, good afternoon, scum bags.
 We're going to blow your (beep) building up
 piece of (beep)
 - I don't wish to sit here and say
 that this is something that happened 18 months ago.
 This is something that continues to happen
 every single day for us.
 Last Friday, we had an office on lockdown.
 Two days prior to that, I was on a phone call
 with one of our employees,
 who's a mother of two, very upset and crying.
 It's hard to talk about.
 - Had something been said to her personally?
 - A very disgusting death threat in detail.
 - Received on her personal cell phone?
 - It's completely and utterly surreal.
 None of these lies have been substantiated to any extent.
 Every single one of them has been debunked.
 - Chris Krebs was director of the cyber security
 and infrastructure security agency,
 charged with protecting the 2020 election.
 He called it the most secure election in American history,
 and days later, it was fired by President Trump.
 He now has a cyber consulting firm
 and is a contributor for CBS News.
 We showed him a press conference held two days
 after his firing at the headquarters
 of the Republican National Committee
 when Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and others
 continued their attacks on Dominion machines and software.
 It can set and run an algorithm
 that probably ran all over the country
 to take a certain percentage of votes
 from President Trump and flip them to President Biden.
 - Do you remember watching that?
 - Yeah, I tweeted about it immediately afterwards.
 I think I said something along the lines
 that that was the most insane,
 and dangerous 45 minutes of TV
 in American history, effectively.
 How secure was the 2020 election?
 - Let me put it this way.
 It was the most litigated.
 It was the most scrutinized.
 It was the most audited.
 This election was put through the ringer
 from so many different directions.
 And what I tend to like to say is,
 don't listen to me.
 Listen to Bill Barr.
 Bill Barr said it.
 He was then the Attorney General of the United States.
 - This is what Bill Barr later said
 to the January 6 committee.
 - These claims on the Dominion voting machines,
 and they were idiotic claims,
 I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations,
 but they were made in such a sensational way
 that they obviously were influencing a lot of people.
 - Dominion began a learning Fox News
 and other networks of the false allegations.
 They were broadcasting November 12th,
 four days after Sidney Powell first discussed Dominion
 with Maria Bartiromo.
 But Dominion says Fox News never retracted their reporting.
 - You gave them a lot of chances
 to correct their statements.
 - They still haven't corrected them.
 To me, that's the most powerful part of the complaint.
 - Lee Levine is a First Amendment attorney
 who's litigated cases for 40 years
 on behalf of most media companies, including CBS and Fox.
 He's retired now, but his old firm
 is currently representing CNN and me in a separate matter,
 filed by attorneys who also represent Dominion
 in its cases against Fox News and others.
 - Take the Fox case, for example.
 November 12th seems to be the key date in that case
 because that's the day that Dominion started
 on a regular basis sending information sheets
 to every producer on, every show at Fox
 that was having Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani on saying,
 ""Here are the true facts.
 Here are links supporting our assertions
 that these are the true facts.""
 And then these people continued to invite Giuliani
 and Powell on their shows.
 - Defamation cases are hard to prove, aren't they?
 - Yes, they are.
 The plaintiff has to prove the law calls actual malice.
 You need to show basically that the defendant
 published a broadcast, a deliberate lie,
 a calculated falsehood.
 - They knew it was a lie when they broadcast it.
 - They knew it was a lie or they knew it was probably a lie.
 How strong is Dominion's case against Fox and the other?
 - I think it is much stronger
 than most defamation cases that I have seen.
 I might say it is the strongest.
 - How many defamation cases have you seen?
 - I have litigated myself hundreds
 and I'm certainly aware of every significant defamation case
 in the last 40 years.
 - And this is the strongest one?
 - In my judgment.
 - In a statement to 60 minutes,
 Fox said it's confident it will prevail,
 citing freedom of the press protections
 and stating it was reporting on a newsworthy allegation
 made by the then-president and erred segments
 fact-checking the allegations against Dominion.
 Dominion is suing Fox News and its parent corporation
 for $1.6 billion each.
 And in its statement, Fox said
 that Dominion's financial demand is unsupported.
 Efforts by Fox News and other defendants
 to have the lawsuits dismissed
 have been rejected by the courts.
 - Do you think that you can show
 not only that they lied, but they knew that they were lying?
 - Yeah, I don't even think, I think that's the easiest part.
 - You as a company told them specifically, repeatedly.
 - We told them, we told them in real time.
 Others told them, government officials told them.
 Partisan government officials told them.
 People inside the Trump administration told them.
 Local election officials on both sides of the aisle told them.
 This is not a matter of not knowing the truth.
 They knew the truth.
 (clock ticking)
 Two years ago, most Americans voted for change.
 And if the polls are to be believed,
 they're about to do it again.
 In the latest CBS News New York Times poll,
 80% said they want most incumbents out of Congress,
 regardless of whether that incumbent
 is a Democrat or a Republican.
 There is a grim mood among people
 who were counting on a recovery that's now fallen flat.
 The economists who decide such things
 say that the Great Recession ended back in June of 2009.
 But since then, we've lost another half million jobs,
 which helps explain why there is so much anger in the land.
 We saw a lot of it right in the middle of the country,
 among the people who've endured the recession longer
 than anyone.
 - What surprised you the most about this recession?
 - I think the depth of it and the length of it,
 I think what's rising the most about this one
 is it just doesn't want to end.
 - You know, the economists say that the recession's over.
 - Really?
 - They should come to New Iowa.
 (laughing)
 - Dave McNier's advertising company
 is like a lot of small businesses, it's getting smaller.
 Maxim Advertising in Newton, Iowa
 puts its customers' logos on nearly anything,
 and business had only grown for 22 years until 2007.
 - And what was all of this?
 - This was filled Maytag, Maytag, Maytag, Maytag.
 - Maytag invented its washing machine
 in Newton 103 years ago.
 5,000 people worked for Maytag here,
 but Newton lost all of those jobs.
 Maytag was bought out, and by 2007,
 the factory was closed.
 Many of the jobs went to Mexico.
 No one knew it then,
 but these were the opening days of the Great Recession.
 Now, layoffs that started with corporations
 are cascading into mom-and-pop shops.
 - How many employees did you have at the top?
 - 22. - And today?
 - 10. - Do you remember
 the first person you had to lay off?
 - One of the very hardest days of my life.
 My wife and I stayed up all night long.
 We talked, we prayed, we struggled, and you know what?
 Man, that's a gut-wrenching feeling.
 You hate it.
 I hate it, and I never wanted to have to do it again.
 - I wonder, when you look forward now,
 what you think about rehiring people?
 - When we hire somebody, we're definitely gonna need 'em.
 I mean, we're gonna hire one person
 until we need two or three,
 and we're probably not gonna hire two
 until we need four or five.
 - And that's why the recovery is lifeless.
 Big and small, businesses have settled
 into doing more with fewer people.
 You ask people to step it up and work harder,
 work longer, make less.
 - Is it sort of a new normal?
 - I think for now it is.
 - Take a quick look around Newton.
 Gary Forbes laid off half of his 60 employees,
 closed two locations,
 and switched from selling top quality furniture
 to scratched and dented.
 Website designer Cindy Bruner laid off six
 of her 14 employees.
 This was the Chrysler dealer, the Chevy dealer,
 the tractor supply company.
 Since the recession, we've seen a lot of troubled towns
 in the country, but nothing that looks quite as broken
 as Newton.
 Even the local chapter of the Optimus Club has closed.
 - You know, I wanna tell everybody
 that we're a company town,
 or the company left, but we're gonna thrive.
 - Chaz Allen is the mayor of this town of 15,000 people.
 It's a part time job, pays about $4,000 a year.
 Allen walked us through an abandoned Maytag plant
 that, at its peak, held 2,500 factory workers
 building washers and dryers.
 If anyone out there is interested,
 the mayor has more than 1.7 million square feet to rent.
 - It is available, it is available, make a good deal.
 - The mayor's been trying to pull new jobs into town.
 He made a run at Green Energy and got a company
 that makes wind turbine blades.
 But every time he gets a few hundred jobs,
 he seems to lose a few hundred.
 This fall, a telecom company called Windstream
 had two layoffs.
 - It was 60 and then it was 146 the next time.
 How's that affect people around here?
 - You know, it's a roller coaster.
 I wanna say that, I mean, I was affected in the first layoff.
 I was one at the Windstream that was affected
 the first round.
 - Wait a minute.
 - Yeah.
 - They laid off the mayor?
 - Yeah.
 - Are you working now?
 - No.
 - His town is shrinking.
 This year, they closed an elementary school
 and they're slashing the city budget.
 - Have you already lost policemen?
 - Yes.
 - Firemen?
 - Yes.
 - What about the hospital in town?
 - It's being reduced in size as well.
 - And that is the backdrop for Tuesday's election.
 In our national poll, we asked,
 what's the most important issue in America?
 54% said jobs.
 Healthcare came in second at 7%.
 Only 1% said the war.
 Newton's congressional district is bipartisan country.
 It voted for George Bush in 2004
 and then for President Obama.
 - Hi, how you doing?
 - But now Democratic Congressman Leonard Boswell
 is fighting for his job.
 He's been reelected here six times,
 but this week, his race against Republican Brad Zahn
 is too close to call.
 - My wife and I watched the news last night
 and I think every ad was a political ad.
 - Who do you trust with your money, with your future?
 It's not Brad Zahn.
 - Leonard Boswell, too wrong for too long.
 - Incredibly, Bruce Brailey supports building
 a mosque at ground zero.
 - How much relevance does all of that have to you?
 - Nothing.
 - Doesn't have a bit of relevance to me.
 - We invited some of the folks in town to the Legion Hall.
 How many of you would say that you're angry
 about politics right now?
 Oh, that got a big yes.
 - I'm sick and tired of people going to Congress
 in Washington, D.C. and making a living out of it
 while we starve to death.
 Does it matter much to anyone in here
 whether the Republicans or the Democrats
 control the House, for example?
 Does it matter?
 - If a Republican says it, the Democrats don't listen.
 If the Democrats say it,
 the Republicans don't care what they're saying.
 What gets done in Washington?
 What gets done at the Iowa State House?
 Very little gets done.
 I mean, everything comes down to either abortion issues,
 gay marriage issues, it needs to go above and beyond that.
 - I don't have a job.
 That's all I care about.
 I don't care about the Republicans or the Democrats.
 I care about Newton, Iowa, the job situation,
 the financial situation.
 - We went to the foreclosure auction the other day.
 Nobody bid on anything.
 Nobody has any money.
 - Help us.
 Do something about the economy.
 It's really hard out here.
 - The economy is not spurring jobs.
 - Todd Meyer was laid off from the same telecom company
 that laid off the mayor.
 You served in the Gulf War.
 - I did.
 - You were in the Navy in combat there.
 - USS George Washington.
 - And now you're unemployed.
 - Yes.
 - Meyer and his wife, Theresa, are raising three kids,
 their daughter, Caitlin, is the first in the family
 to go to college.
 - I get emotional about it because it's just,
 you know, we never expected to be in this position,
 but you know, I look at my daughter and I just think,
 how do I keep her in college?
 - It's every parent's dream to send their child to college,
 especially if that parent didn't have the same opportunity.
 - I've had this dream since I was really little,
 and my parents have done everything they can,
 and it's just starting to get hard,
 and I'm gonna try and help out,
 but it's hard to see that dream slip away.
 - How many of you think that your children
 will enjoy the same standard of living that you did?
 - This worry, pessimism really,
 weighs on families who had seen a different future.
 - How many employees did you have at the peak?
 - 22.
 - How many do you have now?
 - I'm down to seven.
 - Half pepperoni, half pineapple.
 - All right, fantastic.
 - Scott Creech bought his own pizza franchise in Newton
 21 years ago.
 How many hours are you working?
 - Last week it was 82.
 - 82 hours in a week?
 - Correct.
 - How long can you do that?
 - Until I die.
 - Sales have slipped to a place
 that's sometimes dangerous for his family.
 - Once you get down around this area,
 I may be able to file for food stamps.
 His wife Julie is working at a school
 to take some of the pressure off.
 - He's 52 years old now and I worry about him every day.
 His brother died of a heart attack when he was in his 40s
 and I worry about that all the time.
 - Hello everybody.
 - His son Parker is 10.
 Creech comes home to put Parker in bed
 but then he heads back to the shop.
 He washes up and closes up about 1 a.m.
 I wonder what the stress has been like for you.
 I've been blessed.
 You know, you have guilt.
 Guilt about what?
 You'd like to have that eight to five job,
 holidays off, but you can't do that now, no.
 Nationwide, the number of small businesses
 going bankrupt each year has tripled since the recession.
 There were 60,000 bankruptcies last year alone.
 - When you're looking for the path out of this flat recovery,
 there are a couple of things that strike you.
 One, small businesses create most of the jobs
 in this country, 65% of all new jobs.
 But lending to small businesses is actually declining.
 In the second quarter of this year,
 lending to small businesses and farms dropped by $13 billion.
 That's nearly 2%.
 So three years after the beginning of the Great Recession,
 with interest rates the lowest they've ever been in history,
 banks are lending less money to the engines that create jobs.
 - Have you gone to the bank?
 - Yeah, that's amazing 'cause you hear stories
 about how lending is gonna be more friendly
 and even the president himself is gonna tell banks
 that they need to understand what businesses are going through.
 There's no banks, the banks don't understand anything.
 They won't loan me a dime.
 - And you went to the bank and they said what?
 - Come back when you have a couple of good years behind you.
 - Really 'cause I won't need you then.
 - They'll offer money to you when you don't need it,
 but when you need it, you can't get it.
 - Perfect, okay, we'd like to hear that.
 Here's your answer.
 He has been losing money at his jewelry store
 on the courthouse square for a year and a half.
 He makes a lot of his own jewelry
 and to try to match his customers' falling income,
 he switched from gold to silver, diamonds to beads.
 His employees, Darlene Swank and Tina Kono
 even volunteered to cut their hours.
 - You're gonna have to let Tina and Darlene go.
 - It's hard, it's hard.
 - Do you remember when you had to sit down
 and explain it to him?
 - Yeah, I talked to Darlene first.
 I didn't have to say anything.
 She knew.
 You know, she does her books and she knew.
 - And what did the books tell you?
 - Help me understand.
 - You just can't keep doing what you're doing.
 As hard as it is, we tried.
 - His store closed this weekend.
 More layoffs reduce demand, which creates more layoffs.
 Change may be coming again to Washington,
 but in Newton, many believe the struggle will stay the same
 as family businesses work to steal another day
 from the Great Recession.

 a scientist later on and we talked about logic and how you could make these kind of mathematical
 systems which worked out logic and I'd heard about this Goethels' theorem which seemed
 to say that there were things in mathematics that you just couldn't prove and I didn't
 like that idea but I when I heard the when I went to this course by Steen and he explained
 what it really says and what it says is suppose you've got a method of proving things in
 mathematics and when I say things I mean things with numbers the one famous example is Fermar's
 last theorem there's the Goldbach conjecture which isn't yet proved the very even number
 bigger than two is the sum of two prime numbers that's the sort of example of the thing it's
 just sort of mathematical things about numbers which you can see what they mean but it may
 be very difficult to see whether it's true or untrue but the idea is often is in mathematics
 you've got a system of methods of proof and the key thing about these methods of proof
 is that you can have a computer check whether you've done it right so you these rules you
 know they could be adding in beats the same as BNA and things like that and you if you
 give your you say to the computer say that here is a theorem like Goldbach conjecture
 and you see whether it can be proved and you say maybe I've got a proof and this follows
 these steps and you give it to the computer and it says yep you've done it right it's
 true or maybe we say you've done it right and it's not true or it may not say anything
 might just go on forever but these are the sort of outcomes and the point about it is
 that if you believe that these procedures do give you a proof in other words that if
 the algorithm says yeah it's true then you believe that it is true because you've understood
 all the rules you looked at the first one so yeah that's okay you look at the second
 one said mama ah yeah I see okay that's great and you go all the way down and as long as
 you're convinced all those rules work and if it says yes that's something you believe
 okay now what girl shows as he constructs a very specific sentence a statement which
 is a number thing like like the fair must last theorem or something the thing about numbers
 which what he shows is if you trust this algorithm for proving mathematical things then you can
 see by the way it's constructed that it's true but you can also see by the way it's constructed
 that it cannot be proved by this procedure now this was amazing to me because it tells
 me that okay you cannot formalize your understanding in in a scheme which you could put on a computer
 the you see this statement which girl comes up with is something you can see on the basis
 of the same understanding that allows you to trust the rules that it's true but that
 it's not actually derivable by the rules if you see it's true by virtue of your belief

 It's kind of a sales tool.
 And internally, the last thing you want to do is sell.
 You're truth seeking, you're trying to find truth.
 The other problem with PowerPoint is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience.
 And a memo is the opposite.
 It's hard to write a six page memo.
 A good six page memo might take two weeks to write.
 You have to write it, you have to rewrite it, you have to edit it, you have to talk to people about it.
 They have to poke holes in it for you, write it again.
 It might take two weeks.
 So the author, it's really a very difficult job.
 But for the audience, it's much better.
 Senior executives interrupt with questions halfway through the presentation.
 A question's gonna be answered on the next slide, but you never got there.
 I often write lots of questions that I have in the margins of these memos.
 And then I go cross them all out because by the time I get to the end of the memo, they've been answered.
 Other probably with PowerPoint friends, they're often just bullet points.
 You can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points.
 When you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure,
 it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking."

 And the reason that's always stuck with me
 is because every time in my career, and there are many,
 where I've made some mistake in communicating,
 where I've had some failure of communication,
 it's almost always come down to some assumption

 There could be multiple consciousnesses.
 Of course, one will not be aware of the other, and possibly not even able to infer the agency
 even if it was.
 We do not become conscious after the PhD.
 We become conscious before we can drag a finger.
 So I suspect that consciousness allows the self-organization
 of information processing systems and nature.
 Yoshi Bach and Carl Fristen, today's field-occution guests, are known for their work in artificial
 intelligence, neuroscience, and philosophical inquiry.
 Bach, an AI researcher, delves into cognitive architectures and computational models of
 consciousness and psychology.
 Fristen, a neuroscientist, is lauded for his development of the free energy principle.
 A theory explaining how biological systems maintain order.
 This framework of neural processes is rooted in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.
 Yoshi has been on this podcast several times.
 One solo, another with Ben Gortzel, another with John Verveke, another with Michael Levin,
 and one more with Donald Hoffman.
 Whereas Carl Fristen has also been on several times, twice solo,
 another between Carl Fristen and Michael Levin, and another with Carl and Anna Lemke.
 That one's coming up shortly.
 The first hour of today's talk is broadly on agreements so that we can establish some terms.
 The second hour roughly is on points of divergence,
 and the third is on more dark philosophical implications,
 as well as how to avoid existential turmoil precipitated by earnestly
 contending with these heavy ideas.
 For those of you who don't know, my name is Kurt Gymungal,
 and there's this podcast here called ""Theories of Everything"" where we investigate theories of
 everything from a physics perspective primarily as my backgrounds in math and physics.
 But as well as I'm interested in the larger questions on reality, such as
 what is consciousness, what constitutes it, what gives rise to consciousness,
 what counts as an explanation.
 You could think of this channel as exploring those questions you,
 while at least I sit and ponder at nighttime and daytime incessantly.
 Enjoy this Theolucution with Yoshabok and Carl Fristen.
 All right, thank you all for coming on to ""Theories of Everything"" podcast.
 What's new since the last time we spoke?
 Yosha, the last time was with Ben Gorzo,
 and Carl, the last time, was at the active inference institute.
 So Yosha, please.
 Oh, there's so much happening in artificial intelligence.
 We have more on a weekend than normal TV show has in seven seasons.
 So it's hard to say what's new.
 For me personally, I've joined a small company that is exploring alternative to the perceptron.
 I think that the way in which current neural networks work is very unlike our brain.
 And while I don't think that we have to imitate the brain,
 we have to figure out what kind of mathematics the brain is approximating.
 And we are trying to make that famous that.
 Great. And Carl.
 Very similar, actually.
 I guess what's new in the largest scheme of things, of course, is the advent of large language
 models and all the machinations that surround that.
 And the focus that has caused in terms of what do we require of intelligent systems?
 What do we require of artificial intelligence?
 What's the next move to generalized artificial intelligence and the like?
 So that's been certainly a focus of discussions, both in academia and in industry,
 in terms of positioning ourselves for the next move and the implications it has,
 both in terms of understanding the mechanics of belief updating and
 the move from the age of information to the age of intelligence, but also the philosophy
 and the principles. And interestingly, the conclusion amongst me and my friends is exactly
 what Joshua articulated, which is a sort of more a commitment to a more biomimetic understanding
 of natural intelligence.
 Right. I read your paper, ""Mortal Computation, a Foundation for Biomimetic Intelligence.""
 And while we can get right into that, Karl, on page 15, you define what a mortal computation is
 as it relates to Markovian blankets. Can you please recount that?
 And further, you quote Kierkegaard, which says that life can only be understood backwards,
 but must be lived forwards. So how is that connected to this?
 Right. You are a voracious reader. That was only for all kinds of few days ago.
 I do my research, man. And also, I did not write that. That was my friend, Alexander.
 You can take a credit. What? We'll remove this part.
 I can't take the credit because I don't know about any of the philosophy, but I thought it was
 they're largely his ideas, but they resonate certainly again with this sort of notional
 commitment to a biomimetic understanding of intelligence.
 And that paper, that particular paper sort of revisits an ocean of mortal computation
 in terms of what does it mean to be a mortal computer? And the importance of the physical
 instantiation, the substrate on which the processing is implemented as being part of the computation
 in and of itself. So that speaks closer to all sorts of issues. The potential
 excitement about neuromorphic computing, if you're a computer scientist, the importance
 of in memory processing. So technically, you're trying to elude the value and bottleneck on the
 memory wall. And I introduced that because that is speaks to, from an academic point of view,
 the importance of efficiency in terms of what is good belief updating, what is good, what is
 intelligent processing. But from a most societal point of view, the enormous drain on our resources
 incurred by data farms, by things like large language models in eating up energy and time and money
 in a very non-bimetic way. So I think mortal computation as a notion, I think has probably
 got a lot to say about debates in terms of direction of travel, certainly in artificial
 intelligence research. But you'll have to unpack the philosophical reference on me.
 So, Josha, you also had a paper called A Path to Generative Artificial Cells with your co-author
 Mian Gabora. Sorry, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that correctly. Toward the end of
 the paper, you had some criteria about selfhood, something called Max Raff, which has Raff's as a
 subset, and there were about six or seven criteria. Can you outline what you were trying to achieve
 with that? What Raff is, and what does personal style have to do with any of this?
 Lian likes to express her ideas in context of autocatalytic networks. But if we talk to
 a general audience, I think rather than trying to unpack this particular strain of ideas and
 translate it into the way in which we normally think about these topics, I think it's easier to
 start directly from the bottom, from the way in which information processing systems and nature
 differ from those that we are currently building on our GPUs. Because the stuff that we built on
 our GPUs is designed from the outside in. We basically have a substrate with
 well-defined properties. We designed the substrate in such a way that it's fully deterministic,
 so it does exactly what we wanted to do. And then we impose a function on it that is computing
 exactly what we wanted to compute. And so we designed from scratch what that system
 should be doing, but it's only working because the system is at some lower level already
 implementing all the necessary conditions for computation. And we are implementing a
 functional approximator on it that has functional approximation to the best of our own understanding
 with a global function that is executed on this neural network architecture. And in biology,
 this doesn't work. Also in social systems, these are all systems where you could say
 they are from the inside out. So basically there are local agents, cells, that have to
 impose structure in the environment. And at some point, they discover each other and start to
 collaborate with each other and replicate the shared structure. But before this happens,
 there's only chaos around them, which they turn gradually into complexity. And so the
 intelligence that we find in nature is something that is growing from the inside out into a chaotic
 world, into an unknown world. And this is a very different principle that leads to different
 architectures. So when we think about an architecture that is growing from the inside out,
 it needs to be colonizing in a way, and it needs to impose an administration in the environment
 that basically yields more resources, more energy than the maintenance of this administration costs.
 And it also needs to be able to defend itself against competing administrations that would
 want to do the same thing. So you are the set of principles that outcompetes all the other
 principles that could occupy your volume of space. And the systems that do this basically
 need to have a very efficient organization, which at some point requires that their model
 themselves, that they become to some degree self-aware. And I think that's why, from a
 certain degree of complexity, the forms of organization, if we find both in minds and in
 societies, need to have self-models. They need to have models about what they are and how they
 relate to the world. And this is what I call sentience. And in our sense, it's not the same
 thing as consciousness. Consciousness is this real-time perceptual awareness of the fact that we are
 perceiving things that creates our perceptual individual subjective now. But sentience is
 something that I think can also be attained by, say, a large corporation that is able to model
 its own status, its own existence in a legal and practical and procedural way. And that is
 training its constituents to people who enact that agent following all the procedures that
 is necessary for keeping that sentience larger system that is composed of them alive. And so
 when we try to identify principles that could be translated into nervous systems or into
 organisms consisting out of individual self-interested cells, we see some similarities.
 We basically can talk about how self-seasonizing agents emerge in self-organizing systems.
 So Carl, I know quite a slew was said. If you don't mind saying, what about what
 Yosha had spoken about coheres with your model, your research, or what contravenes it?
 No, I was just marbling how consilient it is. Usually a lot of my favorite words
 also reminds me of people like Mike Levin. It'd be nice to... I don't know if
 Josh has had the chance to speak with Mike, but he would again, I think, fully endorse that
 perspective. Actually, Yosha has spoken to Michael Levin, and the link to that will be in the description.
 I've never heard the inside-out metaphor before, but I think that's absolutely right. It sort of
 chimes in the anti-clock's notion of sense-making and sentient. It's a very constructive inside-out
 process. It's not just trying to extract information from the sensorium. You actually
 actively sampling and actively generating hypotheses for sensations. And crucially,
 you are in charge of the sensory data that you are making sense of, which speaks exactly to,
 I think what Josh was saying in terms of designing and orchestrating and creating an ecosystem in
 that sort of inside-out way. That sounds absolutely consistent with certainly the perspective on
 self-organization to non-equilibrium steady state. So talking about stable, sustainable
 kinds of self-organization, again, that you see in the real world and quintessentially
 binematic. If you wanted, I think, to articulate what we've just heard from the point of view of a
 physicist who's studying non-equilibrium steady states, that's exactly the kind of thing that
 you get. Even to the notion of the increasing complexity of a structural sort that requires
 this sort of consistent harmonious ecosystem of exchange that would be read, for example,
 as generalization of chaos in dynamical systems theory. Another key point that was brought to
 the table was this notion of how essentially it has to have a self-model. Immediately I was
 reminded of the early cybernetics movement and notions of the good regulator theorem
 from Ross Ashby. But I think Josh has taken that slightly one step further than Ashby and his colleagues
 in the sense it is a model of self. And I think that's an important move because you can have
 a good regulator. You can have a thermostat that arguably, well, what's governor?
 The arguably has an implicit mortal computational model of its world. But to be an agent,
 I think you have to have a model of you as an agent in that ecosystem.
 Almost invariably when I speak to both of you, the concept of self comes up. I think we could do a
 control F in the transcript, and we'll see that it's orders of magnitude larger than the average
 amount of times that word is mentioned. And I'm curious as to why. In part, that's because of the
 channel, the nature of this channel. But is there something about the self that you all are trying
 to solve? Are you trying to understand what is the self? Are you trying to understand yourselves?
 Carl, if you want to tackle that.
 The problem of naturalizing the mind is arguably the most important remaining project of human
 philosophy. And it's risky and it's fascinating. And I think it was at the core of the movement
 when artificial intelligence was started. It's basically the same idea that Leibniz and Frigge
 and Wittgenstein pursued. And basically this idea of maximizing the mind. And the modern version of
 mathematics is constructive mathematics, which is also known as computation. And this allows us
 to make models of minds that we can actually test by re-implementing them. It also allows us to,
 at some point, connect philosophy and mathematics, which means that we will be able to say things
 in a language that is both so tight that it can be true and we can determine the truth of statements
 in a formal way. And the other side is so deep and rich that we can talk about the actual reality
 that we experience and observe. And to close this gap between philosophy and mathematics, we
 need to automate the mind because our human minds are too small for this. We need to identify the
 principles that are approximated in the workings of biological cells that model reality and then
 scale them up in a substrate that can scale up better than the biological computations that are
 our own skulls and bodies. And this is one of the most interesting questions that exist. I believe
 it is the most interesting and most important question that exists. The understanding of our
 personal self and how this relates to our mind and how our mind is implemented in the world
 is an important part of this. And while it's personally super fascinating, I guess also for
 many of the followers of your channel, it's quite programmatic in its name and direction.
 This is to me almost incidental. On the other hand,
 notice an absence of seriousness in a lot of neuroscientists and AI researchers
 who do not actually realize in their own work that when they think about the mind
 mental processes and mental representations and so on, that they actually think about
 their own existential condition and have to explain this and integrate this. So we have to
 account for who we are in this way. And if we actually care about who we are, we have to find
 models that allow us to talk about this in an extremely strict, formal, and rational way.
 And our own culture has, I think, a big gap in its metaphysics and ontology, which happened
 after we basically transcended the Christian society. We kicked out a lot of terms that existed
 in the Christian society to talk about mind, consciousness, intentionality, and so on.
 Because there seem to be superstitious overloaded with religious mythology and not tenable.
 And so in this post-enlightenment world, we don't have the right way to think about what
 consciousness and self and so on is. And part of the project of understanding the mind is
 to rebuild these foundations, not in any kind of mythological superstitious way, but by building
 on our first principles thinking that we discovered in the last 200 years, and then gradually
 build a terminology and language that allows us to talk again about consciousness and mind and
 how we exist in the world. So for me, it's a very technical notion in the self. It's just
 the model of an agent's interest in the universe that is maintained by a system that also maintains
 a model of this universe. So my own self is basically a puppet that my mind maintains
 about what it would be like if there was a person that cared. And I perceive myself
 as the main character of that story, but I also noticed that there is intelligence outside of
 this existing, coexisting with me in my own brain, that is generating my emotions and generating
 my word model, my perception, and so on, basically keeping the score and all the pain and pleasure
 that experience is generated by intelligent parts of my mind outside of my personal self.
 I can also get to a point where a transcendence distinction and realize that I am the one that
 creates this, but this is not going to be a human eye, not a human personal self that realizes this,
 but a self-identification of the mind itself that is producing a model of reality and of
 the organism's interests in it. Well, Carl was left to be said. Well, he's just said it.
 I can see there's a pattern here. I'll say what he just said in different words, if I can.
 So yeah, I love this notion of using the word naturalization. I think naturalizing things in
 terms of mathematics and possibly physics is exactly the right way to go. And it does remind me of
 my friend Chris Fields notion that our job is basically to remove any bright lines between
 physics, biology, psychology, and now philosophy. And I think mathematics is the right way to do that.
 Or at least the formalism, the calculus that you get from mathematics or possibly category theory,
 whatever, that can be instantiated in silico, or ideally in any,
 again, governmental computation. So I think that's a really important point. And to speak,
 I think to a broader agenda, which was implicit in Josh's
 review, which is the ability to share a common ground, to share a generative model of us in a
 lived world where that lived world contains other things like us. So the one, I think,
 requisite for just existing in the shared world is actually having a shared model. And then that
 brings all sorts of interesting questions to the table about, is my model of me the same kind of
 model that I'm using of you to explain you, to ascribe to you intentionality and to all those
 really important states of being, or at least hypotheses from the point of view of
 predictive processing accounts, hypotheses that I am in this mental state and you are in that
 mental state. So I think that was a really important thing to say that we need to naturalize our
 understanding of the way that we work in our worlds. In relation to the importance of self,
 again, to sinking from the point of view of physicists, that you cannot get away from the
 self, if you just start at the very beginning of information theoretic treatments, self-information,
 for example, that's where all starts for me, certainly regarding variational theology as a
 variational bound on self-information. And then you talk about self-organization,
 talking all the way through to the notion of self-evidancing, as Jacob Howie would put it,
 every point you are writing down or naturalizing the notion of self at many, many different levels.
 And indeed, if one generalizes that, you're almost specifying the central importance of
 thingness in the sense that I am a thing, and by virtue of saying, I am implying inducing a certain
 self aspect to me as a thing. And again, that's the starting point for certainly the free energy
 principles approach to this kind of self-organization. I repeat, I think Josh is taking us one step
 further though in terms of it, we can have ecosystems of things. But when those things now
 start to have to play the game of modeling whether you cause that or whether I cause that, that now
 brings to the table an important model of our world that there is a distinction between me and you.
 And as soon as you have this fundamental distinction, which of course would be something that a newborn
 baby will have to spend hours, possibly months building and realizing that mum is separate from
 the child herself. So I think that's terribly important. One final thing, just to speak again to
 the importance of articulating your self-organization in terms of things like intentions and beliefs
 and stances, I think that's also quite crucial. And what it means, if you want to naturalize it
 mathematically, you have to have a calculus of beliefs. So you're talking basically a formulation
 either in terms of information theory or probability theory, where you're now reading the probabilistic
 description of this universe and the way that we are part of that universe in terms of beliefs
 and starting to think about all the physics in terms of some kind of belief updating.
 Karl, you use the word shared model. Now is that the same as shared narrative?

 Monarch Money.com/podcast. Yes. Common ground, if you're too much. So, yeah. I mean, I use it
 literally in the sense of a generative model that somebody in generative AI would understand the
 notion. So, if we talk about self-model as a special kind of generative model that
 actually entertains the hypothesis that I am the cause of my sensations and just took us through
 the myriad of sensations that I need to explain, then we're talking about self-models as part of
 my generative model, where that includes this notion that I am the agent that is actually
 gathering the data that the generative model is modeling. So, the generative model is just a simple
 specification. Again, from the physics perspective, it's actually a probabilistic description
 of the characteristic states of something, namely me, that can be then used to describe
 the kind of belief updating that this model would have to events in order to exist when embedded in
 a particular universe. Other readings of a generative model would be exactly the common ground that we
 all share. Part of my generative model would be the way that I broadcast my inference, my belief
 updating using language, for example. That requires a shared generative model about the
 or the semiotics and the kind of way that I would articulate or broadcast my beliefs.
 That generative model is a model of dynamics. It's a model not just of the state of the world,
 but the way that the transition dynamics, the trajectories, the paths, and I'm using your
 narrative just as a euphemism for a certain kind of path through some model state space.
 So, if you and I share the same narratives in the sense that we are both following the same
 conversation and the same mutual understanding, we are sharing our beliefs through communication,
 then that is exactly what I meant. To fall out to happen, we have to have the same kind of generative
 model. We have to speak the same language and we have to construe things and infer things in
 exactly the same kind of way. I just want to just slip in frames of reference and
 a light and frames of reference, another way of looking at that kind of thing.
 Yoshi, is there anything there that you'd like to respond to?
 I suspect that what makes this project so difficult, that our models of reality are
 necessarily coarse-grained. They don't describe the universe as it is in a way in which it can
 exist from the ground up, but they start from the vantage point of an observer that is sampling
 the universe at a low resolution, both temporal and spatial, and only very few dimensions.
 And this model that is built on a quite unreliable and deterministic substrate.
 And this puts limitations on what we can understand with our unaugmented mind.
 Sometimes a joke that the AGIs of the future will like to get drunk until the point where they
 can only model reality with 12 layers or so and they have the same confusions as human physicists
 when trying to solve the puzzles that physics poses. And they might find this hilarious,
 because many of the questions that have been stamping us during the last 130 years since we
 have modern physics might be easily to be able to resolve if our minds were just a little bit better.
 We seem to be scraping at a boundary of our understanding for a long time. And now we are,
 I think, at the doorstep of new tools that can solve some puzzles that we cannot solve and then
 break them down to us for us in a way that is accessible to us because they will be able to
 understand the way in which we model the world. But until then, we basically work in overlapping
 realities. We have different perspectives on the world and the more we dig down, the more
 subtle the differences between our models of reality become. And this also means that if you
 have any kind of complex issue, we tend not to be correct in groups. We tend to be only sometimes
 individually correct in modeling them and we need to have a discourse between individual minds
 about what they observe and what they model, because as soon as a larger group gets together
 and tries to vote about how to understand concept like variational free energy, all the
 subtleties are going to be destroyed, because not all of the members of the groups will be
 understanding what we're talking about. So there will be place, the more subtle understandings with
 a common ground that is not modeling reality with the degree of resolution that would be necessary,
 or they're not able to break things down to first principles. And this first principles
 understanding, I think, is an absolute prerequisite when we want to solve foundational questions.
 I sometimes doubt whether physics is super well equipped for doing this. When I was young,
 I thought physics is about describing physical reality, the world that we are in and some level.
 And now I see that physics is an art. It's the art of describing arbitrary systems using short
 algebraic equations. And the stuff that cannot be described with short algebraic equations yet,
 it's like chemistry is ignored by physicists and left to lesser minds. And only 8% of the
 physicists after their degree end up working in physics in any traditional sense, the others
 work in process design and finance and healthcare and many, many other areas where you can apply
 the art of modeling arbitrary systems using short algebraic equations. And whenever that
 doesn't work, physicists are not worth very much. I've seen physicists trying to write programs,
 and many of them have the spires of trying to come up with algebra and geometry,
 where calculus would be much better or where automata would be much better. And nature doesn't
 care about this. Nature is using whatever works, whatever can be discovered. And very often,
 that is close to the toolkit of this intellectual tradition of the physicists. But I think it's
 sometimes helpful to see that all these intellectual traditions that our civilization has built
 start out with some foundational questions and then congregate around a certain set of methods.
 And it can be helpful to just vote on the outside of all these disciplines for a while and then move
 around the kingdom and look at them and study their tools and see what common ground and what
 differences we can discover. I was quite shocked when I learned that a number of machine learning
 algorithms had been discovered in the 80s and 90s by econometrists. And we're just ignored
 in AI and had to be reinvented from scratch. And so I suspect there is a lot of these things
 happening in our tower of Babel that we are creating across sciences because our languages
 start to differ in subtle ways and sometimes fundamentally mismodal reality or ignore it to
 the point where I think most living neuroscientists are practically dualists. They will not say it
 out loud because that's been frowned upon. But they don't actually see a way to break down
 consciousness, mind, and self into the self that would run on neurons. Or they don't even think
 about the causal structure in the same way as you would need to get to this point. And as a result,
 they believe that thinking about these concepts is fundamentally unscientific. It's outside of the
 pursuit of science and they do this only in church on Sundays. Yeah. So what's the solution to this
 tower of Babel? Of course, it's AI. The solution to everything is AI. You basically need to build
 a system that can think better than us and help us with it. Okay, Carl, do you also see the problem
 similarly? And do you see the solution similarly? I think I do. Well, as long since I'm nice
 by my magic AI, I love this notion of I hope no physicists are watching. And also the only
 physicists that I know all want to do neuroscience or psychology in addition to economics and health
 care, which is, which is all small particle physics, and it's either neuroscience or small particle
 physics. And as I get older, I am increasingly compelled by arguments that I've read from very
 senior, old physicists that it's all about measurement. It's all about observation. And in a sense,
 all of physics is just one of these generative models. That has this particular capacity to
 disseminate itself so that we do have this common language and this common ground. So,
 you know, just to reiterate one of Joshua's points, you know, physics in and of itself is
 just another story that we find particularly easy to share. But I do take the point that even
 within physics, there is this tendency to become siloed with my kind of common ground, as opposed
 to your kind of common ground. So, I know this notion of the overlap. And I was just reflecting upon
 the veracity of that, even in my little world, you know, so the free energy principle is unashamedly
 committed to classical formulations of the universe in terms of random dynamical systems and large
 value equations. And that would horrify quantum physicists and quantum information theorists,
 who just wouldn't think about that. You know, again, that's why I slipped in that reference
 to reference frames early on, because what we're talking about now is the alignment of quantum
 frames of reference. But that uses a completely different language. And that I think is, you know,
 part of the problem that Joshua's bring to bring to the fore that what we need is something that's
 so broadener that joins the dots, you know, and may well require transcending the particular
 common ground or physics or calculus or philosophies that have endured. So, if by that,
 the artificial intelligence is going to be one way of joining the dots so that people in machine
 learning don't have to reinvent the wheel every, you know, every generation, then I think he's
 absolutely right. Whether I call that artificial intelligence or not, I'm not so sure. I think
 it would start to become part of part of a grander ecosystem that would have a natural aspect to it.
 But perhaps, perhaps I could ask you, Joshua, do you actually mean artificial intelligence
 in the sense that it doesn't have a moral or a biological aspect to it? Or do you just think
 something that goes beyond our own sense-making and self-modeling as individual scientists or people?
 Maybe I don't understand your notions of mortality and biology completely. To me, biology means that
 the system is made of cells, of biological cells, of cells that are built on a carbon
 cycle foundation on the chemical reactions that nature has discovered and translated into
 machines made from individual molecules that interact in very specific ways.
 And it's the only agent that we have discovered to occur in nature, I think.
 And all the other agents we discover are made by all of cells. And mortality is an aspect of
 the way in which multicellular systems adapt to changing environments. They have offspring that
 mutates and then get selected against. And as a result, we have a change trajectory that can be
 calibrated to the rate of change in an ecosystem. And this is one of the reasons for mortality.
 Another reason for mortality is if you set up a system that has sub-optimal self-stabilization,
 it is going to deviate from its course. Imagine you build an institution like the FDA and you
 set it up to serve certain purposes in society after a few generations to people. Isn't that
 organization to a very large degree start serving the interests of the organization and the interests
 that have captured the organization? And so it becomes not only larger and more expensive,
 but it's at some point it's possibly doing more harm than good. It doesn't mean that we don't need
 an FDA, but it might mean that we have to make the FDA model so it gets reborn every now and then
 and can put itself back on track based on a specification that outside observers think is
 reasonable rather than a specification that needs to be negotiated with the existing stakeholders
 visit in that organization and a few people who are left outside. And I think this is one of the
 most important aspects of mortality, but imagine that all of earth would be colonized by a single
 agent, something that is able to persist not only across organisms, but is also able to think
 using all other molecules that can be turned into computational systems and to representational
 architectures and agentic architectures. You have a planet that is similar to
 Zannislav-Lems Solaris, a thinking system that is realizing what it is, that realizes that it's
 basically a thinking planet that is trying to defeat entropy for as long as possible and this
 end builds complexity. Why would the system need to be mortal? And would that system still be
 biological? It would be self-organizing, it would be dynamic, it would be threatened with death,
 with non-existence, it would react to this in some way. But I'm not sure if biology and mortality
 are the right categories to describe it. I think these are more narrow categories that apply to
 biological organisms in the present setting of the world. I had picked up on a phrase you said Carl,
 which is one of the solutions, maybe AI, that's what you were saying in response to Yosha's,
 which makes me think, had Yosha not mentioned AI as the resolution to the indecipherability across
 discipline boundaries. What would you have said a solution or the solution would be?
 Well, I think the solution actually lies in what Yosha was just saying, in the sense that
 if the self-understanding is seen in the context of exchange with others and that
 provides the right kind of context. I think we're talking, I've used the word a lot now,
 I'm talking about an ecosystem at any arbitrary scale and an ecosystem that provides that opportunity
 for self-evidancing, so to use Yosha's phrase, that just is a statement that you've got an
 itinerant, open kind of self-organization that maintains this minimum entropy state in exactly
 the same way that Yosha was intimating. So I'm just thinking about what is implied in this
 conversation by mortal computation and mortality in the context of things that die. I do actually
 think that they are being used in exactly the same sense and use in the sense that is
 an inevitable aspect of self-organizing systems that will endure over time in the sense of minimizing
 the entropy of the states that they occupy, and I do think that is the solution, which is
 where I was pushing back against artificial intelligence, but for a particular reason.
 The way that its mortal computation is framed certainly in that paper, which I was the second
 author, is that immortal computers are built around software, so they are immortal in the sense
 you can rerun the same program on any hardware. If the running of the software and the processing
 that ensues is an integral part of the hardware at which it is run, then it becomes mortal and
 that's important because the opportunity for dying if you are mortal now creates the kind of, if you
 like selective pressure from an evolutionary perspective of exactly the kind that Yosha was
 talking about, that if you don't have the opportunity to die, if you don't have the opportunity to
 dissemble the FDA because it's no longer fit for purpose, then you will not have a sustainable
 self-organization that continually maintains a low entropy in the sense that it has some
 characteristic recognizable states. So I think there is a deep connection between
 self-organization that we see in biological, social, possibly meteorological systems
 and a certain kind of mortality in which, for example, information about the kind of environment
 that I am fit to survive and to learn about is part of my genomic structure, but to realize that
 if you like evidence accumulation through evolutionary mechanisms, I have to have a life cycle,
 I have to have to die and I'm not implying that everybody has to die in order to leave,
 I'm implying that there has to be some kind of dynamics, there has to be a life cycle,
 it could be an economic life cycle, it could be boom and bust, for example, but that has to be part
 of this self-evidancing and certainly an exchange in the kind of multicellular
 context that Joshua was mentioning. So by mortal, I just mean by reading of mortal in this particular
 conversation would be, say, yes, it is the kind of biological behavior that is characteristic of
 cells that self-assemble but also die in one attractive metaphor that came to mind when talking
 about the FDA becoming to an organization, becoming too big for its own good and not being
 a good model of the system in which it is immersed, so it's not meeting customers' needs,
 it's not even meeting, its own needs would be a tumor. So you could understand a lot of the
 institutional pathologies and geopolitical pathologies, possibly even climate change,
 possibly even the current excitement about what's going to happen to over an AR or your big tech,
 all of this can, I think, be read in terms of a process of mortal computation at a certain scale
 where there is an opportunity for things to go away, to dissolve. That has to be the case in the
 same way that either the tumor kills you or it necrosis because it kills off its own blood supply,
 it can't be any other way, really. There isn't a certain way you can evolve an immune response
 against tumors. If you are an organism that lives to be much longer because it has slower
 generational change, they typically have better defenses against tumors than the shorter lived
 organisms like us, and basically a tumor can be seen as a set of tissues or a subset of agents,
 like you can principle have a tumor and an ant colony that is playing a shorter game than the
 organism itself, in the larger system itself. You can sustain a number of tumors if your
 environment does not put too much pressure on you, but at some point the tumors are going to
 bring you down. For instance, I think that the free world has to make at some point a decision
 of whether it is accepting to be brought down and replaced by a different type of social order,
 or whether it's going to evolve or build or construct or design an immune response against
 tumors and criteria to identify them and remove them. I think that's not a natural law,
 at least I don't see how to prove from first principles that we cannot overcome a problem like
 institutional calcification or turning of institutions into tumor-like structures,
 functionally. I think it might be possible to do that. The cell itself is not mortal. The cell
 is pretty much a mortal. The cell is individual cells can die and disappear, but the cell itself
 is still the first cell. It's just splitting and splitting and it's alive and all of us.
 Every cell in our own body is still this first cell just split off from it. The way in which
 organisms die and so on is just a detail in this larger project of the cell, which itself is so far
 a mortal. When I talk about AI being the solution to everything, of course, I'm joking a little bit.
 I'm just echoing some of the sentiment and part of the enthusiastic culture of my young field,
 but I'm only joking a little bit because I think that AI has the potential to
 reverse engineer the general principles of a learning agent of a system that is able to model
 the future and regulate for the future and make functions in an arbitrary way. I would
 replace the notion of the hardware with substrate. Of course, it's still hardware,
 but it can be an arbitrary substrate and the substrate can also be to a large degree
 software, which means causal principles that are implemented ultimately on physics,
 but this causal structure ultimately is a protocol layer that allows you to
 basically implement a representational language in which an agent can realize itself as a causal
 structure. I think that AI is working currently on very different substrates than the biological
 ones, but there is a super set of these principles that can make AI subset agnostic.
 I think that the implication of the children's thesis is that it doesn't really matter which
 hardware you're using. In practice, it does matter because if a hardware is not very deterministic
 or it doesn't give you a lot of memory or it's very slow, you will know the big differences,
 but if you abstract this away, the representational power and the potential for agency is not really
 dependent on your hardware. It turns out that the hardware that you're currently using for AI
 is much, much more powerful than the hardware that biology is using. The reason why AI is so weak
 compared to human minds or biological systems is because the algorithms that we have discovered,
 we have discovered them by hand. These were people tinkering. Sorry, what do you mean the AI is weak?
 I mean that in order to get a system that is almost coherent, we need to train it with the
 entire internet. This almost everything that humans have ever written. As a result, we get a system
 that is using tremendously more resources than a human brain has at that disposal. I'm not talking
 about the computational power that is implemented in an individual cell that might be very large,
 but the part of the power of the individual cell that is actually harnessable by the brain for
 performing computation. That is very little. It's only a small fraction of what the new one is
 doing to do its own maintenance housekeeping, metabolism, communication with neighbors that is
 actually available for building computation at the brain level. As an example, I sometimes use this,
 the stable diffusion rights when they came out. Stability AI is an AI company that makes open
 source models. They made a vision model by training with GPUs on hundreds of millions of images and
 text drawn from the internet and cross-correlating them until you can type in a phrase and then get
 a picture that depicts that phrase. It's amazing that this works at all. Likewise, enormous computational
 power because it's far less inefficient compared to a human brain that is learning how to draw pictures
 after seeing things. These weights, this neural network, they know everything. Basically, they know
 how to draw all the celebrities and how to draw all artistic styles and all the plans. Everything
 is in there. It's just two gigabytes. You can download it. It's only two gigabytes. It's like 80%
 of what your brain is doing is captured in these two gigabytes. It's so much more than what a human
 brain could reproduce. It's absolutely brute forcing it. At the other time, two gigabytes doesn't seem
 to be a lot, which suggests that our own brain is probably not storing effectively much more
 information than a few gigabytes. That's very humbling. The reason why we can do so much more
 visit and so much faster than the AI is not because biological cells are so much more efficient than
 transistors. It is because they are self-organizing. It has been at this game for quite some time. It
 figured out a number of tricks that human engineers couldn't figure out so far.

 I hope you get to the differences now. I just wanted to celebrate this notion that the cell
 in a sense is immortal because, of course, the whole point of this is to try and understand
 systems that endure over long periods of time. That's what I meant, whether I didn't mean the
 death meant cessation. I just meant there's a certain life cycle, my tendency in play.
 So I thought that was nicely illustrated by the notion that the cell is, in a sense, unending.
 But the mortal immortality is more about divorcing the software from the substrate.
 There's a bit of a pushback, then, if you want to look for differences in the respective
 arguments, then a lot of people would say that all the housekeeping that goes on in terms of
 intracellular machinations and self-organization, that just is basal computation at a particular
 level. And it's the more macroscopic kinds of belief updating and processing and computation,
 supervene, at a certain scale. And indeed, that progression in a sort of scaling variant sense
 is one manifestation of what you were talking about before, that biological things are cells
 of cells of cells of cells and have increasingly higher kinds of scales and different kinds of
 computation. But the idea that the first principles apply at every and each level.
 And it's the same principle at every and at each level. And if you pursue, though,
 one has to ask why modern AI, or particularly machine learning, is so inefficient,
 dangerously inefficient. And there's, I think, a first principle account of that, and the
 account would go along the following lines. The only objective function that you need to
 explain existence is a likelihood of you being your marginal likelihood that statistically
 is the model evidence. The model evidence or the log of that evidence can always be written down
 as accuracy minus complexity. Therefore, to exist is to minimize complexity.
 Why is that important? Well, first of all, it means that that coarse grading that we were
 talking about earlier on is not a constraint. It is actually part of an existential imperative
 to coarse grading the right kind of way. The other reason it's important is that there is
 a thermodynamic link between the complexity scored in terms of belief updating or processing or
 computation and the thermodynamic cost. And if that's the case, it explains why
 the direction of travel in terms of your machine learning is so inefficient.
 And what it tells you is that there is a lower limit on the right way to do things.
 There is a lower limit on the thermodynamic efficiency and the information computational
 efficiency specified by the Landau limit. Why does modern or current machine learning
 not get anywhere close to that Landau limit? Possibly two, three, four, not six orders of magnitude
 living above it. Whereas the brain is actually much, much closer to that lower limit in terms
 of the efficiency, both are repeat, thermodynamic and information, the theoretical kinds of efficiency.
 And the answer is I think the von Neumann bottleneck. It is the memory wall.
 It is that people are trying to do computation in an immortal sense by running software without
 careful consideration of the substrate on which they're running or implementing that computation.
 So I would push back against the notion that it is even going to be possible
 irrespective of its right direction of travel in terms of artificial intelligence research
 or indeed computer science research, I had to push back against the notion that artificial
 intelligence, read as a running of some immortal software on a von Neumann architecture, is the
 solution. I think that solution has to be more biomimetic by which I mean it has to actually run
 on a substrate. It doesn't have to be a biological cell, but certainly has to conform to the same
 principles of multi-scale self-organization of the most efficient sort. That just is
 the optimization of the marginal likelihood or the evidence for the states that that particular
 computing device or computer wants to be in. So that's what I had a slight sort of hesitation
 about agreeing about the promise and potency of artificial intelligence. I don't think that's
 the right way to go about it. I would actually come back to your very initial argument,
 Joshua, that it has to be much more biologically inspired. It has to be much more biomimetic.
 And part of that sort of inspiration is the motivation for looking at the distinction between
 immortal software on von Neumann architectures, on Nvidia chips relative to a much more biometic
 approach, say photonics or neuromorphic computing. I think that really does matter in terms of
 getting as to a situation, getting as a solution. I'm not sure there is a solution. There's a
 solution to the differential equations that has a well-defined objective function in my world,
 but certainly getting useful artificial intelligence in the same spirit that the FDA
 is fit for purpose and doing a useful job. Okay, let me push back against this.
 First off, I do agree that current AI is brutalist in this sense that it is not
 making the best use of the available substrates and it's not building the best possible substrates.
 The number of parts effects is not that the stuff that we are building and using is not clever
 or so, but it's a far cry from what biology seems to have discovered. At the same time,
 there is relatively little funding going into AI and this relatively little energy consumption
 given what it gives you. If academics here that it costs $20 billion to train a model,
 they are almost faint because they compare this with their departmental budget.
 But if you would compare this with the cost of making half a decent AI movie in Hollywood,
 it's negligible. Basically, what goes into an AI project is far less than what goes
 into a Hollywood movie about AI. If you compare this at the scale, if you look at the societal
 benefit of watching an AI movie or watching another blockbuster about the Titanic or so,
 it's not now, but I think that AI has the potential to be dramatically more valuable than this.
 So I think that even though it might sound counterintuitive, it's not using
 a lot of energy and it's not very well funded at the moment still compared to what the value
 of it is. Also, the leading labs do not believe that the transformer is going to be the architecture
 that we have in the end. It just happens to be one of the very few things that currently works
 at scale that we have discovered that can actually be scaled up in this portal this way.
 It's already better at completing prompts than the average person. It's even better than writing
 code than many people. It can translate between programming languages. You can write an algorithm
 down in English and it can even help you to write down an algorithm down in English and then
 translate it in the probing language of your choice and it's pretty good at it. It can also,
 if it makes a mistake and it often makes mistakes, understand the compiler messages and then try to
 suggest fix the set of work. In many ways, I've found that it's already better than a lot of people
 I've worked with in corporate contexts, both at writing press releases and at writing code.
 It's not as good as the top level people in their field, but it's quite surprising.
 And so there is this interesting open and tantalizing question. Can we scale this up by using slightly
 better loss function, by using slightly more compute, sliding word and better curated data?
 And the systems can help us curating data and coming up with different architectures and so on
 to get this thing to be better at AI research than people. If that gets better at AI research
 than people, then we can leave the rest to it and go to the beach. And it will come up with
 architectures and solutions that are much more efficient than what we have come up with.
 At the same time, there are many labs and teams that work on different hardware, that work on
 different algorithms at the same time. The fact that you see so much news about the transformer at
 this point is not so much because everybody ignores it and doesn't work on it anymore or has religious
 beliefs and the transformer being the only good thing. It's because it's the thing that currently
 works so well. And people are trying to work on all the other things, but the thing that has the
 most economic impact and the most utility happens to be the stuff that currently works.
 And so this may cloud our perception if you think it's the von Neumann architecture and so on,
 but in some sense, the GPU is no longer a von Neumann architecture. We have many pipelines that work
 in parallel that take in smaller chunks of memory that are more closely located to the
 local processor. And while it's not built in the same way as the brain where all the memory is
 directly inside of the cell or its immediate vicinity, it is much closer to it. And it's able
 to emulate this. And if I look at the leading neuromorphic architectures, I can emulate them
 on a CPU and it's not slower. This is all such research stuff that is early stage. But you're
 not emulating neuromorphic architectures on a CPU for the most part, which is GPU or GPU,
 but just largely because it doesn't give us that many benefits over the existing architectures and
 libraries. Or the existing architectures and libraries work so well that people use this stuff
 for now and it creates a local bubble until somebody builds a new stack that is overtaking it.
 And I think this is all going to happen at some point. So I'm not that pessimistic about these
 effects. What I can see is that our computers can read text at the rate that is impossible for
 human beings when you parse the data into a large language model for training it. And it's in some
 sense, radically, fl historian program next token prediction. It's really trying to predict the
 future and minimize its surprise. That's the core of this algorithm. With this paradigm,
 it gets to be coherent in the limit. It leads to an interesting question. Maybe this paradigm is
 not correct. Maybe humans are doing something different. Maybe humans are maximizing coherence
 or consistency. And we have a slightly different formal definition and live on Earth or agency
 in universe might be minimizing free energy in the limit. But individual organisms are not able
 to figure that out. And they do something that is only approximating it, but locally works much
 better and converges much faster. So maybe there are different bus functions that we have to discover
 that are more biological or more similar to a biological systems. Also, one of the issues with
 biomimetic things is it means mostly mimicking the things that scientists in biology and neuroscience
 have discovered so far. And this stuff all doesn't work. And the reason why Mike Levin doesn't call
 himself a neuroscientist, I suspect, but a synthetic biologist is that he doesn't want to get in
 conflict with the dogmatic approaches of some neuroscience, which believes that computation
 stops at the neurons. It's only neurons that are involved in computing things. It could be when
 you look at brains that they are basically telegraph networks of an organism that the neuron is a
 telegraph cell. It's not unique in its ability to perform computation. It's only unique in its ability
 to send the results of computation using some kind of Morse code over long distances in the
 organism. And when you want to understand how organisms compute and you only look at neurons,
 it might be looking at the economy about 1900 and trying to understand it by only modeling
 the telegraph network. You are going to learn fascinating things by looking at an economy,
 looking at its telegraph network and looking at the Morse code, but thinking that communication
 can only happen in this Morse code rather than sending RNA molecules to your neighbors.
 Why would you want to send spike trains if you can send strings? Why would you want to perform
 such computations in a slow, awkward way? Why would you want to translate information into the time
 domain if you can send it in parallel all at once? So when we talk about biomimetic, we often talk
 about emulating things that you only partially understand and that don't actually work in a
 simulation. There is no working conic term right now that you can turn into a computer simulation
 and that actually does what it's doing. And it's not because computers don't have the power to run
 the ideas that neuroscientists have developed, but neuroscientists don't have developed ideas
 that actually work. It's not that neuroscientists are stupid or their ideas are not promising,
 they're just incomplete at this point. We don't have complete models of brains that would work in AI.
 And the reason why AI has to reinvent things from scratches because it takes an engineering
 perspective, it thinks about what would nature have to do in order to approximate this kind of
 function and what's the most straightforward way to implement this and test this theory. This is
 this experimental engineering perspective that I suspect we might also need on neuroscience,
 not in the sense that we translate things into a phenomenon architecture in neuroscience,
 but in the sense that we think about what would nature have to do in order to implement the
 necessary mathematics to model reality. All right, neuroscientists.

 I'm the neuroscientist. I largely agree entirely with many of those things. I'm just trying to
 remember the ones that I can argue with. I love this notion that there's more money going into
 Hollywood films about AI than actually AI research. I've never heard that before. That's marvelous.
 Also, the point about GPUs. I think that's just a reflection of the natural selection in the AI
 community of what I was trying to say before about the move away from von Neumann architectures
 to more mortal computing. If you've talked to people doing it in memory processing in memory
 as computer science, that's where they're like everybody to be. That's what I meant really by
 that aspect of mortal computing. The infrastructure and the buses and the message passing,
 having everything local is speaking to the hardware implementation. I agree entirely. That
 is the direction of travel. I didn't want to imply that GPUs were the wrong way of doing it.
 Also, I agree. I wasn't really referring to transformer architectures. As you say, they just
 highly expressive, very beautiful Bayesian filters and are now currently being understood as such.
 As my friend Chris Buckley would say, people are starting now to
 base, explain how a transformer works. What would I disagree with? I noticed that you
 on a number of occasions were trying to identify the universal objective function,
 doing things better. It being really good because it could translate lots of languages,
 having greater utility. Do you generally think that there is some magic utility
 function out there that has yet to be discovered? Do you think that AI is going to discover that
 magic utility function? Will that be the answer? Well, I think that automatic utility relates to
 what makes the system stable and self-sustaining. If you look at any kind of agent, it depends on
 what conditions can stabilize that agent. This comes down to very much the way in which you model
 reality, I think. It is about minimizing free energy in a way. If you look at our own lives,
 and you look for a sandwich, or for a laugh, or for a relationship, or for having the right
 partner to have children with, and so on, you're not thinking very much about minimizing free
 energy. We perform very local functions because we are only partial agents in a much larger system
 that you could understand as the project of the cell, or as the project of building complexity to
 survive against the increasing entropy in the universe. Basically, we need to find sources
 of neck entropy and exploit them in a way that we can. This depends on the agent that we currently
 are. This narrows down this broader notion of the search for free energy into more practical and
 applicable and narrow things that can deviate locally very much from this pure, beautiful idea.
 With respect to principle that should be discovered, or has to be discovered, it might be discovered
 in the context of AI. I suspect that self-organizing systems need different algorithms than the
 GPUs that we're currently using for learning, because we cannot impose a global structure on them.
 I suspect that there is a training algorithm that nature has discovered. That is in plain sight,
 and that we typically don't look at, and that's consciousness. I suspect the reason why every
 human being is conscious, and a no human being is able to learn something without being conscious.
 It's not producing complex behavior without being conscious. It's not so much because
 consciousness is super unique to humans and evolved at the pinnacle of evolution and got bestowed on
 us and us alone. We do not become conscious after the PhD. We become conscious before we can drag
 a finger. I suspect that consciousness itself is an aspect, or depending on how you define the
 term consciousness, the core of meta-learning algorithm that allows the self-organization
 of information processing systems in nature. It's a pretty radical notion. It's a conjecture
 at this point. I don't know whether that's true. This idea that you have is a function that perceives
 itself in the act of perceiving. It's not conceptual. It's not cognitive. It's a pre-cognitive level,
 the perceptual level, where you notice that you're noticing, but you don't have a concept of notion
 yet. From this simple look that keeps itself stable is controlling itself to remain stable
 and remain observer, where the observer is constituting itself and observer. You build all the other
 functionality in your mind. You start imposing a general language on your substrate, a protocol
 that is distributed with rewards, so neurons become trainable, and learn to speak the same language,
 behave in the same way that every part of the mind is able to talk to all the other parts of the mind,
 and you can impose an organization that removes inconsistencies. This is probably that thing that
 is one of the big differences between how biological systems learn and control the world,
 and how artificial engineered systems do it. I agree entirely. You've brought so many bright
 and interesting ideas. It's difficult to know what to comment upon. Just one thing which you said,
 when I pressed you on what is good, you're basically said to survive. I think that brings
 us again back to this notion of mortality being at the end of the day, the possibility of eluding
 mortality, being part of all. If we drive as an individual, human beings are built in such a way
 that we have to be mortal. We are not designs that can adapt to changing circumstances. If the
 atmosphere changes, if our food supply changes too much, we need to build a different organism,
 we need to have children that mutate and get selected for these new circumstances.
 But in principle, intelligent design would be possible. It's just not possible with the
 present architecture, because our minds are not complex enough to understand the information
 processing of the cell well enough to redesign the cell in C2. And in principle, that's not
 something that would be impossible. It's just outside of the scope of biological minds so far.
 Right. Well, individually, we have to be mortal. But in principle, the cell can be a model or
 there could be systems that go beyond the cell that encompass it, that are a superset of what the
 cell is doing and what other information processing agents could be doing in nature
 that basically makes sustainability happen. And I think sustainability is a better notion in
 some sense than immortality. So, yeah, again, I agree entirely. I often look at the physics of
 self-organization as just a description of those things that have been successful in sustaining
 themselves. And indeed, the free energy principle is just basically what would that look like and
 how would you write that down? And of course, the free energy theorists would argue that the
 ultimate, the only objective function is a measure of that sustainability. That is the evidence that
 you're in your characteristics of centable states. So, if properly deployed, you should be able to
 explain all of those aspects of behavior that characterize you and me in terms of self-evidancing
 or free energy minimization, such as choosing the right partner, such as foraging on the internet,
 such as enjoying a good read. And I think, and this is why I want to fully agree with you in terms of
 that makes that kind of self-sustaining, self-organization
 only understandable in relation to some kind of selfhood. And I think, and I'm using selfhood
 in the way that I think you're using this basic notion of sentience. And what would that mean from
 the point of view of the free energy principle? It would mean basically that you have an existential
 imperative to be curious. So, if you just read the free energy ask or surprise, because you talked
 about sort of predictability before, then if I am choosing how to act next, then I am going to
 choose those actions that minimize my expected surprise or resolve my uncertainty. I'm going to
 be actors if I'm a curious thing. And I bring that to the table, because that is what is not
 an aspect of any of this artificial intelligence that you described before. The machine that can
 translate from one language to another language, the machine that can map from some natural text to
 a beautiful graphic, these are wonderful and beautiful creations and they are extremely
 entertaining, but they are not curious. And as such, they do not comply with the free energy
 principle, which means that they're not sustainable, which means that one has to ask what's going
 to happen to them. Perhaps we might sustain them in the way that we do good art, but from the point
 of view of that kind, perhaps I shouldn't use the word by mimetic, perhaps that's too loaded, but
 the way of sustaining oneself through self-evidancing, I do not think does admit an intelligent design
 of something that is not in itself curious as part of itself organization. So, where would you see
 curiosity as part? Does the FDA have to be curious? Is there any aspect of the utility afforded
 by say reinforcement learning models or deep RL or Bayesian RL? Does that have curiosity as
 under the hardest part of the objective function? I really liked how you bring art into this discussion
 as an example of something that might be similar to an AI system that doesn't know what it's good
 for and only exists because we sustain it. Because it's not self-sustaining. Chet GPT is not paying
 its own energy bills. It doesn't really care about them. It's just a system that is completing text
 at this point. And it might be if you task it with the thing that in it figures out the mathematics
 at some point, but right now it doesn't. And an artist sometimes joke it's a system that has
 fallen in love with the shape of the loss function rather than with what you can achieve. Art is
 about capturing conscious states because they are intrinsically important. Is this art or can
 this be thrown away? It is art. It is important. And in this sense art is the cuckoo child of life.
 It's not life itself. The artists are elves. The living organisms are orcs. They only use art
 for status signaling or for education or for ornamentation. The artist is the one who thinks
 magic is important. Building palaces in our minds showing them to each other. That's what we do.
 I'm much more an artist at heart than I am a practical human being that maximizes utility and
 survival. But I think I also can see that this is an incomplete perspective. It means that I'm
 identifying with a part of my mind with the part of my mind that loves to observe and
 revenge the aesthetics of what I observe. I also realize that this is useful to society because
 it's being able to hold down a particular corner of the larger hive mind that is necessary to be
 done. If I was somebody who would only maximize utility it would be a great CEO maybe. But I would
 not be somebody who is able to tie down different parts of philosophy and see what I can see by
 combining them or by looking at them through a shared lens. And so it's sometimes okay that we
 pursue things without fully understanding what they're good for if we are part of a larger system
 that does that. And our own mind is made out of lots of sub-behaviors that individually do
 not know what we are about. And only together they complete each other to the point where we
 become a system that actually understands the purpose of our own existence in the world to some
 degree. And of course it also goes across people. Individually we are incomplete. The reason why we
 have relationships to other people is because they complete us. And this incompleteness is that we
 have individually is not just inadequacy. It's specialization. The more difficulty we have to
 find our place in the world, the more incomplete we are. But it often also means if we have more
 potential to do something in this area of specialization that we are in. And individually
 might be harder to find that right specialization. But to accept that individual minds are incomplete
 in a way in which they are implemented in biology, I think it's an important insight.
 And this doesn't have to be the case for an AI agent, of course. Or for a godlike agent that
 holds down every fort that is able to look at the world from every angle that holds all perspectives
 simultaneously. Carl, did that answer your question about the curiosity of the FDA?
 Yes. And brings in the sort of primacy of the observer. So now I'm intrigued by this notion
 of being incomplete. Do you want to unpack that a little bit? Yes. First of all,
 Kurt, thanks for pointing out that I didn't talk about curiosity.
 Curiosity ties into this problem of exploration versus exploitation. The point of curiosity is
 to explore the unknown, to resolve uncertainties, to discover possibilities of what could also be
 and what we could also be doing. And this is in competition to executing on what we already know.
 And there is, if you are in an unknown environment, it's unclear how much curiosity you should have,
 or if you're in a partially known environment. And nature seems to be solving this with diversity.
 So you have agents that are more curious, and you have agents that are less curious.
 And depending on the current environment in niche, they are going to be adaptive or non-adaptive
 and being selected for or against. So I do think, of course, curiosity is super important,
 but it's also what kills the cat. Right? That's right. The early warm is the one that gets eaten
 by the bird. And so curiosity is important. It's a good thing that we are curious. And it's very
 important that some of us are curious and retain this curiosity so we can move and change and adapt.
 And it's one of the most important properties in mind that I value, that it's curious and always
 open to interaction and discovering ways to grow and become something else. But it's risky to be
 too curious. And instead, not just exploiting what you already know and act on that and look for
 the simple solution for your problems. I think it's a big problem in science that
 we drive out curiosity of people. The first step in thinking is curiosity, a conjecture,
 trying things that may not work. And then you contract and the PhD seems to be a great filter
 that drives out the curiosity out of people. And then after that, they're able to only solve
 problems using given methods. And they can do this to themselves, this violation of a curious mind.
 Whereas the existential questions somehow stop after graduation. It seems to be some selection
 function against thinking that is happening. That is largely driving curiosity out of people
 because they feel they can no longer afford it between brand proposals. And so in this sense,
 yes, I would like to express how much I cherish curiosity and its importance while pointing at
 the reason why not everybody is curious all the time. And too much of a good thing is also bad.
 Right, and the incompleteness now. Carl, do you want to go more into this?
 Let me finish. Sure, that's so much. Bring it back to cut incompleteness in seconds.
 Yes. So I was just, no, again, I love that. And just a moment, Yoshua, would it be possible for
 you to expand on the early worm gets eaten by the bird because the phrase is that the early bird
 gets the worm, but that doesn't imply that the early worm gets eaten by the bird
 because they could have different overlapping schedules. And in fact, it could be the late worm
 that gets eaten. And there is such a thing as a first mover advantage.
 Autovista got eaten by Google because instead of giving people the search results, it wanted,
 it gave them ads. And now Google has discovered that it's much better to be Autovista,
 but Autovista got eaten by Google. It was too early. Google has now given up on search.
 It instead believes in just giving you a mixture of ads that rhyme on your search term.
 And right. So you could say that Autovista was the early worm, just trying to do a job on
 my frustration with Google. But I think that very often we find that the earliest attempts to do
 something cannot survive because the environment is not there yet. The pioneers are usually sacrificial.
 There is glory in being a pioneer. There is no glory in copying what worked for the pioneer.
 But there is very little upside in greatness. Understood. Carl.
 Well, I came, you know, greatness, yeah, which is not good. Greatness is not good. You are
 becoming back to the tumor again. The art of good management, you know,
 just riffing on your focus on art and just thinking, you know, what makes a good CEO?
 Is somebody makes lots of money and is utilitarian? Or does he have the art of good management and
 considers the objective function, the sustainability of his institution and her institution and all
 the people that work for it? I think there are very different perspectives on what this objective
 function should be. And I was trying to argue before that it's not, it can't be measured in
 terms of greatness or money or utility. It can only be measured in terms of sustainability.
 The other thing I like was curiosity. So here's my little take on that.
 Curiosity killed the cat. I think that is exactly what was being implied by the importance of
 mortal computation and that it has since we all die as a result of being curious after a sufficient
 amount of time and it can be no other way. I mean that in the sense that in a very technical sense,
 so if you were talking to aficionados and active inference, an application of the free
 energy principle, what they would say is that in acting, in dissolving the exploration,
 exploitation, dilemma, you have to put curiosity as an essential part of the right objective function
 that underwrites our decisions and our choices and our actions simply in the sense that the
 expected surprise or the expected log evidence or self-information can always be written down as
 expected information gain and your expected utility or negative cost, which means that the
 justice statistics of self-organization bake in curiosity in the sense that
 you will choose those actions that resolve uncertainty. You choose those actions that have
 the greatest information gain. So curiosity I think is a necessary part of existing and certainly
 things that exist in a sustainable sense. But my question was what I wanted to know more about
 the intriguing notion that we are incomplete and let's consider it in the context of other things
 like us that constitute our lived or at least sensed world. But I just wanted to also ask,
 do you see curiosity as being necessary for that kind of consciousness that you associated
 with centuries before? Would it be possible to be conscious without being curious? Acknowledging
 there are lots of things that are not curious. Viruses, I suspect, are not curious. Trees are
 probably not that curious. They don't plan their actions to resolve uncertainty. But there are
 certain things that are curious, things like you and me. So I'm just wondering whether there is some
 there are different kinds of things, some of which are more elaborate in terms of the kind of self
 evidencing that they invince in sustaining themselves, automatically using auto-catalytic
 mechanisms. And there are other things that are less so. Would that go hand in hand with having
 the kind of consciousness that you were talking about that entails itself? At TLC Laser Eye Centers,

 I think that a good team should also contain curiosity maximizers.
 People that mostly are driven by curiosity. And so you have a voice in your team,
 and I love being that voice that is driven by finding out what could be.
 And you also need people who focus on execution and who are not curious at all.
 And in this way, I think we can be productively incomplete.
 If you have somebody who is by nature, not very curious, but is able to accept the value of somebody
 who is, and vice versa, we can become specialists at being curious or at execution.
 And when we can inform and advise each other, we can be much better than we could be individually
 if we would try to do all those things simultaneously. And in the sense, I believe that if you are a
 state-building species, you do benefit from this kind of diversity. If you're not an individual
 agent, it has to do all the things simultaneously. I don't know how curious traits are. I'm somewhat
 agnostic with respect to this. I suspect that they also need to reduce uncertainty.
 And I don't know how smart trees can become. When I look at means and motive of individual
 cells, they can exchange messages to their neighbors. I can also make this conditional.
 Evolution is probably getting them to the point where they can learn.
 So I don't see a way to stop a large multicellular organism that becomes old enough to become somewhat
 brainlike. But if it does it have neurons, it cannot send information quickly over long distances.
 So it will take a very long time compared to a brain or nervous system for a tree to become
 coherent about any observation. It takes so much time to synchronize this information back
 and forth that the tree would observe locally. And as a result, I would expect that the
 mental activities of the tree, if they exist, which I don't know, to play out at such slow timescales
 that it's very hard for us to observe. And so what does it look like if a tree was sentient?
 How would it look different from what we already observe? And no, we noticed that trees are
 communicating with other trees, that they sometimes kill plants around them, that they make decisions
 about that. We know that there are networks between fungi and trees that seem to be sending
 information over longer distances and forests. So trees can prepare an immune response to pests
 that invade the forest from one end while they're sitting on another end. And we observe all this,
 but we don't really think about the implication, what is the limitation of the sentience over
 forest. I don't know what that is. And I'm really undecided about it, but I don't see a way to
 instantly dismiss the idea that trees could be quite curious and could actually, at some level,
 reason about the world, but probably because they're so slow that the individual tree doesn't
 get much smarter than a mouse because the amount of training data that the tree is able to process
 in its lifetime at a similar resolution is going to be much lower.
 They do live a long time, so I've just tried to defend. I have many friends who you would
 enjoy talking to about that. And you only seem very informed in that sphere. Other ancestors
 were convinced that trees could sink. The fairies are the swimmers of trees, and they move around
 in the forest using the internet of the forest that has emerged over many generations of plants
 that have learned to speak a shared protocol. And I think that's a very intriguing idea.
 You should at least consider it as a hypothesis.
 No, absolutely. There was a great BBC series where they focus on the secret life of plants
 just by speeding up things 10 or 100 times. And they look very sentient when you do that.
 Yes, my ancestors said that one day in fairyland is seven years in human land.
 Maybe this eludes to this temporal difference.
 So about differences between you all, why don't we linger on consciousness?
 And Carl, if you don't mind answering, what is consciousness? Where is consciousness?
 And why is consciousness? So in other words, where is it? Is it in the brain?
 Is it in the entire body? Is it an ill-defined question? What is it?
 Why do we have it? What is its function? And then we'll see where this compares in contrast
 with Yoshi's thinking. Right. I am not a philosopher, and sometimes the story I will tell depends
 on who I am talking to. And it's simplest. I find it easiest to think of consciousness as a process,
 as opposed to a thing or a state, and specifically a process of computation, if you like, or belief
 updating. So I normally start thinking about questions of the kind you just ask me, but replacing
 consciousness with evolution. So where is evolution? What is evolution? Why is evolution?
 Then all of those questions I think are quite easy to answer. Sometimes this is a stupid question.
 Sometimes there's a very clear answer. So where is consciousness? Where is evolution?
 Well, it is in the substrate that is evolving. So where is consciousness? This would be in the
 processes that you are describing consciousness. So I would say it is actually a computational
 information processing, the belief updating that you get at any level. And just fully acknowledging
 Josh's point that it just has to be neurons. It could be my sealed networks. It could be
 into sort of the communication. It could be electrical filaments. There is a physical
 instantiation of a process that can be read as a kind of belief updating or processing.
 If I were allowed to read computation as that kind of process, then that would have,
 that would be, I think, what consciousness, where consciousness would be found.
 Would that be sufficient to ascribe consciousness to me or to something else? I suspect not. I
 think you'd have to go a little bit further and suspect that Josh would want to know particularly
 how much further, but there will be a focus on self modeling. So it's not just a process of
 inference. It's actually inference under a kind of model of the world. I had quite happy
 committing to a general model as formally specified in terms of variational inference.
 But we can relax that and just say some kind of model of the world that entails a certain
 aspect of selfhood to it. So that's what I would say. I put something else into the mix as well.
 To be conscious, I suspect in the way that you're talking about
 means you have to be an agent. And to be an agent means that you have to be able to act.
 And I would say more than just acting, more than acting, say, for example, in the way that
 plants will act to broadcast information that enables them to mount an immune response to parasites.
 They have the capacity to plan, which brings us back to the curiosity again,
 because we normally plan in order to resolve uncertainty. We normally plan our day and the way that we
 spend our time gathering information, gathering evidence from models of the world
 in a way that can only be described as looks as if it is curious. That's why I was so fixated on
 art and creativity and curiosity that Joshua was talking about. People say, I think that is
 probably a prerequisite for being conscious in the sense that Joshua would mean it. But I don't
 know. Perhaps we should ask him. May I ask you a clarifying question, Carl, about belief updating?
 So if consciousness is associated with belief updating, then let's say one is a computer,
 a classical computer. You get updated in discrete steps, whereas the belief updating that I imagine
 you're referring to is something more fuzzy or continuous. So does that mean that the consciousness
 associated with a computer, if a computer could be conscious, is of a different sort? How does that
 work? I'm not sure. I don't think it was any in the same spirit that we don't want to
 over commit to neurons doing mind work. I don't think we need to commit to a continuous or
 discrete space time formulation. Again, that's an artificial divide between classical physics
 and quantum information, theoretical approaches. So I think the deep question is what properties
 must the computational process in a PC or a computer possess before you would be licensed to make
 the influence that it was conscious and possibly even ascribe self-consciousness to that.
 And the way that I would articulate that would be that you have to be able to describe everything
 that is observable about that computing artifact as if or explain it in terms of it acting upon the
 world in a way that suggests or can be explained that it has a model of itself engaging with that
 world. Furthermore, I would say that that model has to involve the consequences of its action,
 which is what I meant by being an agent. So it has to have a model that will act as if it has a
 model, a generative model that could be a minimal self-kind of model, but crucially entails the
 consequences of its own actions so that it can plan, so that it can even secure its like behaviour.
 So that could be done in silica, it could be done with a sort of clock and
 synchronous message passing of a discrete sort or it could be done in analog,
 it could be done with photonics, it could be done on an eromorphic architecture. I don't think
 that really matters. I think it's more the nature of the implicit model under the hood
 that is accounting for its internal machinations, but more practically in terms of what I could
 observe at that computer, its behaviour in the way that he goes and gathers information
 or attends to certain things and not attend. It doesn't attend to other things.
 Okay, great, Yoshua. If we think about where consciousness is, we might be biased by our
 propensity to assign identity to everything and identity does not apply to law like things.
 Gravity is not somewhere, gravity is a law, for instance, or combustion is not anywhere,
 it's a law. It doesn't mean that it happens everywhere in the same way, it only happens when
 the conditions for the manifestation of the law are implemented. When they are realized in a
 certain region, then they can observe combustion happening. But combustion simply means that
 under certain conditions, you will get an exothermic reaction and gravity means that under certain
 conditions, you will find that objects attract each other and consciousness means that if you
 set up a system in a certain way, you will observe the following phenomena. Consciousness in this way
 is a software state, it's a representation state, and all software is not a thing. The word processor
 that runs on your computer doesn't have an identity that would make it separate or the same as the
 word processor that runs on another person's computer because it's a law. It says if you put
 the transistors into this in this state, the following thing is going to happen. So a software
 engineer is discovering a law, a very specific law that is tailored to a particular task and so on,
 but it's manifested whenever we create the preconditions for that law. And so the software design is about
 creating the preconditions for the manifestation of a law of text processing, for instance,
 that allows you to implement such a function in the universe or discover how it is implemented.
 But it's not because the software engineer builds it into existence and it didn't exist
 before that. That's not the case. It always would work. If somebody discovers this bitstring
 in a random way and it's the same bitstring implemented on the same architecture, it would
 still perform the same function. And in a sense, I think that consciousness is not separate
 in different people. It's itself a mechanism or principle that increases coherence in the mind.
 It's an operator that seems to be increasing coherence. At least that's the way I would look at it or frame
 it. And as a result, it produces a sense of now an island of coherence and the potential
 models that our mind could have. And I think it's responsible for this fact that we perceive
 ourselves being inhabitants of an island of coherence in a chaotic world. This is now this island of
 knownness. And it's probably not the only solution for this thing. I think it's imaginable that
 there could be a hyper-consciousness that allows you to see multiple possibilities simultaneously,
 rather than just one, as our consciousness does, or that offers us a now that is not three seconds
 long, but hundreds of years long. And principle that I think is conceivable. So maybe we will have
 systems at some point, but we already have them, that have different consciousness-like structures
 that fulfill a similar role of islands of coherence or interpretable regions in the space
 of representations that allow you to act on the universe. But the way it seems to be implemented
 in myself, it's particularly in the brain, because if I disrupt my brain, my consciousness ceases.
 Whereas if I disrupt my body, it doesn't. This doesn't mean that there are no feedback loops
 that are bidirectional into my body or even outside of my body that are crucial for some
 functionality that observe as a content in my consciousness. But if you want to make me unconscious,
 you need to clobber my brain in some sense, not nothing else. There's no other part of the
 universe that you can inhibit to make me unconscious, and that leads me to think that
 the way in which this law-like structure is implemented is right now for the system that is
 talking to you on my neurons or my brain, mostly. Okay, any objections there, Carl?
 No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to remember, if Mark's souls were here,
 he'd tell you exactly the size of a really small region in the brainstem. I think
 it's less than four cubic millimeters. If you were bladed, you would immediately lose consciousness
 like that. It's a very, very specific part of your neuronal architecture that permits conscious
 processes. But there are also very specific parts in my computer that are extremely small,
 that I could operate and ablate, and I would instantly lead to the cessation of all the interesting
 functions of my computer. And there are many of those regions, where there are basic crucial bottlenecks
 that enable a large-scale functionality. In some sense, everything that would disrupt the
 formation of coherent patterns in my brain is sufficient to inhibit my consciousness.
 And there are probably many such bottlenecks that provide vulnerability. So maybe the classroom
 is crucial in providing some clock function that is crucial for the formation of feedback loops in
 the brain that give rise to the kind of patterns that we need. Maybe there are several other
 such bottlenecks. This doesn't mean that the functionality is exclusively implemented in this
 bottleneck. No, I didn't mean to imply that the pineal cloud is- I didn't say that you would,
 but I thought it would lead to a misunderstanding of the audience. And I've heard famous neuroscientist
 point at such phenomena and say, ""Oh, maybe this is where consciousness happens.""
 When I think this is almost a superstitious belief, it's like saying, ""Oh, there's this
 particular tip on my computer if I destroy it. The computer doesn't work anymore.""
 And maybe this was just the quarts or something else rather than the stuff that is providing the
 interesting functionality. Or the lead to the battery, perhaps. So which neuroscientists have
 said this then? I'm not naming names. You may be afterwards. Just to unpack the reason the mark
 would identify this is it is exactly the cells of origin that are broadcast everywhere and that do
 induce exactly this coherence you were talking about. These are the ascending
 modulator neurotransmitter systems that are responsible for orchestrating that coherence
 that you were talking about. And I think that's very nice because it also speaks to
 the ability of conscious mimicking like artifacts whose abilities to mimic
 consciousness, like behavior, rests upon this modulatory attention like mechanism. I'm thinking
 again of attention heads and transformers that play the same kind of role as the selection that
 these ascending neurotransmitter systems do. So if you find yourself in conversation with Mark
 Soames, he would argue that the feeling of consciousness arises from equipping certain coherent
 coordinated interactions that may be regulated by the cell bell or the cholesterol. But it is
 that regulation that actually equips consciousness with the kind of qualitative feeling that leads
 in the way that Mark Soames addresses. But I mean, just notice that just reviewing what Josh
 just said that he's talking about consciousness, you're equipping us with a sense of now and having
 an explicit aspect that could be, I'm thinking of not hurtful, but I'm well, actually geriatric
 modulus notion of the remembered present, which could be the cognitive moment, 300 milliseconds,
 or it could be if I was a tree, three years, I think it's a lovely notion about the point being,
 we're talking about processes in time. We're not saying at this instant, I am conscious or
 consciousness is here, we're talking about a process that by definition has to unfold
 and fold in time. So, you know, I think that's an important observation, which sometimes eludes,
 I think people debating about state conscious states and conscious content,
 you know, not acknowledging that it is a process, there's a process. What was the example that Joshua
 mentioned? Combustion. You know, combustion is a process. You know, you can't be in a state of
 combustion and you could even argue that it's very difficult to localize at a certain level,
 but the key thing is it's a process. I have an open question and maybe you have a reflection on
 this. When we think about our own consciousness, we cannot know on principle, I think, just by
 introspection, whether we have multiple consciousness in our own mind, because we can only remember
 those conscious states that find their way into an integrated protocol that you can access from
 where you stand. We know that there are some people which have multiple personality disorder
 in which the protocol itself gets splintered. As a result, they don't dream to be just one person,
 they dream to be alternating, to be different people that usually don't remember each other,
 because they don't have that shared protocol anymore. Now, my own emotion and perception is
 generated outside of my personal self. My personal self is downstream from them. I am subjected to
 my perception and emotion. I have involuntary reactions to them, but to produce my perception
 and my emotion, my mind needs intelligence. It cannot be much more stupid than me if my emotions
 would guide me in a way that is consistently more stupid than my reason and my reflection would be.
 I don't think I would work. So, there is an interesting question. Is there a secondary
 consciousness? Is the part of your mind that generates world model and your self-assessment,
 your alignment to the world itself conscious? So, basically, do you share your brain with the
 second consciousness that has a separate protocol? Or is this a non-conscious process that is basically
 just dumped and doesn't know what it's doing? In a sense, that it would be sentient in a way
 that's similar to my own sentence. What do you think?
 You should have a girl in that woman that I can think about.
 Well, something I had wondered about 10 years ago or so, and I don't recall the exact argument,
 was that if it was the case that the graph in our brain, let's just reduce the neurons down to a
 graph, that this graph somehow produces consciousness, or is the same as consciousness,
 then if you were to remove one of those nodes, then you would still have a somewhat the same
 identity. Okay, so then does that mean that we have pretty much an infinite amount of overlapping
 consciousnesses within our brain? I don't recall the exact argument, but it was similar to this.
 And then there's something related in philosophy called the binding problem. I'm uncertain what
 people who study multiple personality disorders have to say about the binding problem, like,
 is that the binding problem gone awry? Can I just then pursue that notion of the
 binding in the context of the kind of thing that, or the way I am at the moment?
 Yeah, I think that's a very compelling notion. From the point of view of generative modeling,
 so I'm not as answering now as a philosopher, but as somebody who may be tasked, for example,
 with building an artifact that would have a minimal kind of selfhood, the first thing you have to
 write down is different states of mind, so that I can be frightened, I can be embarrassed, I can be
 angry, I can be a father, I could be a football player, I could be. So all the different ways that
 I could be that are now conditioned upon the context in which I find myself. And if that's part of
 the generative model that then speaks to two things. First of all, you have to recognize
 what state of mind you are in. And given all the evidence at hand, so for example,
 if I want to jointly explain the racing heart that my interceptive cues are providing me in
 the intercepted domain with a stiffness of my muscles, that my proprioception is equipping me
 with, then to reconcile that with my visual exoceptive input, that I'm in a dark alley,
 and mnemonically, I've never been here before. All of this sensory evidence might be quite easily
 explained by the simple hypothesis I am frightened. And that, in turn, generates covert or mental
 actions and possibly even overt autonomic actions and motor actions that provide more evidence for
 the fact that I am frightened in the sense in the William James sense that out of cardiac
 acceleration, I will have a motor response, a muscular response, appropriate for a flight,
 flight response. So just to actually be able to generate and recognize emotional kinds of behavior,
 I would need to have a minimal kind of model that crucially obliged me now to
 disambiguate between a series of different ways of being. So it's not so much, ""Oh, I am me.""
 That's a great hypothesis. That explains everything. But to make it operationally important,
 I have to actually infer I'm me in this kind of state of mind, this situation, or I mean this
 kind of situation, and select the right state of mind to be in. And I think that really does
 speak to this notion of multiple consciousnesses that cohabit your brain or your generative model.
 And again, speaks this notion of, well, I'm just wondering whether that can be linked to this notion
 of incompleteness in a broader sense. I'm constantly seeking for the way in which I complete you in
 terms of dyadic interactions, which means I have to recognize what kind of person do you expect me
 to be in this setting. And of course, I can only do that if I actually have an internal model
 that is about me. It's a model that actually have this attribute of selfhood, but specifically
 selfhood appropriate to this context or this person or this situation. Does that make sense?
 Yeah, I have a question about that. You said that you have different identities that you then
 select from to see which ones most appropriate for the circumstance, like a hypothesis.
 And is it the case then that you would say that there are multiple
 consciousnesses inside your brain? Or is it more like you have multiple potential consciousnesses
 and then as soon as you select one, that makes it actual?
 I don't know that. I didn't imagine that you have to have another deeper layer of your generative
 model that then recognizes the selection process. And indeed, this may sound fanciful, but there are
 naturalized in terms of infinite schemes, models of consciousness that actually do invoke.
 And I'm thinking of the work of people like Lars Sanstansit Smith
 that explicitly have three levels on each level, a deep judging model,
 very much like a sort of deep neural network. And the role of each level is to provide the right
 attention heads or biasing or precision or contextualization for the processing that goes on below.
 So it may well be that to get the kind of self-awareness, if I now read awareness as
 deploying mental action in the service of setting the precision or the gating
 of various communications or processing lower down in the model, it may well be that you need,
 you do need an other layer of sophistication or depth to your generative models that I suspect
 trees don't help but certainly you have, or I can infer that you have given, I'm assuming that I
 have a similar conception of consciousness. But I'm not sure that really speaks to your question
 or the one that Joshua was posing, that the unitary aspect of consciousness, and does that
 transcend an inference that would simply be biophysically instantiated in exactly the same way that I
 can register visual motion and motion sensitive area V5 in my posterior cortex. I don't know about
 that. I'll pass back to Joshua on that one. Again, we need a very narrow definition,
 the very tight definition of consciousness to answer this question in a meaningful way.
 If we see consciousness as something that we vaguely gesture at, and there could be multiple
 things in our understanding, and it becomes almost impossible to say something meaningful
 about this. So for instance, it is conceivable that consciousness would be implemented by a small
 set of circuits in the brain, and that all the different contents that can experience themselves
 as consciousness or repurposing this shared functionality. We will say we as we probably have
 only one language center, and this one language center can be used to articulate ideas of many
 parts of our mind using different subagents that basically interface with this. You can also clearly
 have multiple selves interacting on your mind. Your personal self is one possible self that you
 can have that represents you as a person. But there are some people which have God talking
 to them on their own mind. And I think what happens there is people implement a self that is
 existing or self identifying as existing across minds, something that is not a model of the interest
 of the individual person, but a model of a collective agent that is implemented using the actions of
 the individual people. But of course, this collective mind that assumes the voice of God and talks to
 you in your own mind so you can perceive it is still implemented on your own mind and uses your
 circuitry. It's just that your circuitry is not yours. Your brain doesn't belong to yourself.
 Your self is a creation of your own mind that symbolizes this person. People who don't say that
 God doesn't exist forget that often that they themselves themselves don't really exist in physics.
 This thing that experienced as perceiving as interacting with the world is a dream. It's a dream
 of what it would be like if you were a person that existed. It's virtual. So you can also dream
 being a God and this God might be so tightly implemented on your mind that it's able to use
 your language center and you hear it's voice talking to you. But it's not more or less real
 than you hearing your own voice talking to you in your mind. It's just an implementation of
 a representation of agency in your mind. One crucial difference to the way in which most AI systems
 are implemented right now and the way in which agency is implemented on our minds is that
 we usually write functions in AI that perform something like 100 steps in a neural network for
 instance and then gives a result that makes a programmer happy. And this is it. And the time
 series predictions of our own mind are dynamic. They're not meant to solve a particular function
 but they're meant to track reality. So in a sense our brain is more like a very complex
 resonator that tries to go into resonance with the world so it creates a harmonic pattern that
 continuously tracks your sense of a data with the minimal amount of effort. And this perspective
 is very different. It means the perception of the world cannot afford to deviate too much in
 its dynamics from the dynamics that you observe, yes, in your sensory apparatus because otherwise
 future predictions become harder. You get out of sync. You always try to stay in sync with the world.
 And this thing that you stay in sync is really crucial for the way in which we experience
 ourselves with the world as part of staying in sync. We discover our own self is the missing link
 between volition and the outcomes of our action. Our body would not be discoverable to us and
 it's not immediately given to us if we wouldn't have this loop that ties us into the outer universe
 and into the stuff that we cannot control directly. And for me this question relates to
 do we have only one consciousness? It occurs to me that we would not know if we have multiple ones
 if they don't share memories. If I were to set up an AI architecture where a part of the AI
 architecture is a model of an agent in the world. Another part of the AI architecture is a model of
 the infrastructure that I need to maintain to make a model of the world in such an agent in the world.
 I would not tell the agent how this infrastructure works because the agent might use that knowledge
 to gain the architecture and get a better outcome for itself, not the organism. Imagine you could
 gain your perception so you're always happy no matter how much you're failing in the world.
 From the perspective of the larger architecture that's not desirable. So it would probably remain
 hidden from you how you're implemented. And to me the question is interesting how sentient
 is this part of you that is not yourself? Does it actually know what it is in real time?
 I think it's a very interesting and tempting philosophical question and also a practical one.
 Maybe there's a neuroscientific experiment that would figure out if you have two clusters
 of conscious experience. I wouldn't know how to measure this. But
 maybe IIT and Global Workspace theory and so on are wrong and more interesting ways than we
 currently think they are. Because they assume that there is just one consciousness. Of course,
 from the perspective of one consciousness there is only one because consciousness is in some
 sense a definition what's unified. But if there are multiple clusters of unification that exist
 simultaneously they would know each other directly. They could maybe observe each other but maybe not
 both directions. Sorry when you say consciousness is by definition one is that akin to how you say
 software is one software as such but specific instantiations of software. So basically most
 more like the universe is by definition only one. But you can have multiple universes but this
 means that we define universe in a particular way. Normally universe is used in the way of
 everything that feeds back information into a unified way. The accept that parts of the universe
 get lost if they go outside of the distance where they can feed information back into you. But there's
 still an event which we think about the universe part of the universe. The universe is everything
 that exists and consciousness is everything that you can be conscious of in the sense.
 Right so if there is stuff in you that you're not conscious of it doesn't mean that it's not
 conscious it would just be a separate consciousness possibly. It could also be that it's not a
 consciousness. And so what I don't know is is a brain structure that can maintain only one
 consciousness at a time or could there be multiple full-on consciousnesses that just don't where we
 don't know about the other one. I perceive my consciousness as being focused on this content
 that is my personal self. I can have conscious states in which I'm not a personal self. For
 instance I can dream at night that there's that stuff happening and I'm conscious of that stuff
 happening but there is no eye. There is no personal self. There's just this reflexive attention that
 is interacting with a perceptual world. In that state I would say I can clearly show that consciousness
 can exist without a personal self and a personal self is just a content. But it doesn't answer the
 question are there multiple consciousnesses interacting on my brain. One that is maintaining
 my reward system and motivational system and my perception and one that is maintaining my personal
 self. Carl now that we've spoken about the unity of consciousness, dissociation as well as even
 voices of God and God, him or herself or itself. What does your background in schizophrenia,
 your perspective from there have to say? Yeah well that's a really question and a
 leading question is what I wanted to comment on. So again so many things have been
 unearthed here from the basic that all our beliefs are fantasies, their hypotheses, illusions
 that are entrained by the sensorium to in a way that maintains some kind of synchrony between the
 the inside and the outside. I think that's quite a fundamental thing which we haven't spoken about
 very much but I just want to fully endorse and of course that entrainment sometimes referred to I
 think as entrained hallucination, perception being your hallucination that's just been entrained by
 sparse data but the data themselves being actively sampled. So this Luke that Yasha was referring
 to I think is absolutely crucial aspect of the whole sense making and indeed sense making as
 a self as the cause of my own or the author of my own sensations in an active sensing or an active
 influence. I think that's absolutely crucial. The question about are the multiple consciousness. I
 should just before addressing the psychiatric perspective there is I have a group of colleagues
 including people like Maxwell Ramsted and Chris Fields and particularly Chris Fields who takes
 the quantum information theoretic view of this and brings the table the notion of an irreducible
 Markov blanket in a computing graph that crucially has some unique properties that means that
 it can only know of itself by acting on the outside or which your other parts of the brain
 and again acting in this instance just means setting the attention or the coordination or
 contextualizing message passing elsewhere but the instinct notion which is not unrelated to the
 pinhole ground gland or mark so-and-so is ascending neurotransmitter systems that might do this kind
 of action and is that there could be more than one minimal or irreducible Markov blanket that
 practically you can actually experimentally define in principle by looking at the connectivity
 of any kind but certainly if you have your sufficiently detailed connect term you can
 actually define the Markov blanket in terms of the directed connections offered by
 external processes and in principle you should apply sort of a kind of
 integrated information theory but slightly nuanced I think in this instance to actually identify
 candidates for irreducible Markov blankets that could be the thing that looks at the thing that's
 doing the thing that's that may have different kinds of experiences you know there could be
 any reducible Markov blanket in say the globus pallidus there might be that might be making
 sense of and acting upon the machinery that underwrites our motor behavior and our plans and our
 choices as opposed to something in the occipital lobe that might be more to do with perception so
 I'm just saying that you know I don't think it's a silly question to ask you know can't really
 empirically identify candidates in computing architectures that would have the right kind of
 attributes that would be necessary to you know to to to to ascribe them some minimal kind of
 of consciousness but let me return to this key question last question because as Josh was talking
 it it did strike me yes that's exactly what goes wrong in schizophrenia you know attribution of agency
 delusions of control hearing you know hearing voice again coming back to this notion that you know
 this action perception loop this circular coupling to the world that rests upon action that has an
 agent and the consciousness understood as self modeling is all about ascribing the right agency
 to the outcomes of action I think is a really important notion here and it can go horribly wrong
 you know you know we spend the first years of our lives it's working out I cause that and you cause
 that and working out what I can cause and what I can't cause and what mum causes and what other
 people cause imagine that you lost that capacity imagine that you know when you spoke and this is
 Chris Fritz notion or expression for auditory hallucinations for example you would have recognized
 that it was you that was the initiation of that speech act whether it's actually articulated or
 subvocal so just not being able to infer selfhood in the sense of ascribing agency to the concept
 the sense of consequences of action would be quite devastating and of course you you can think about
 reproducing these kinds of states with certain psychometric or psychedelic drugs you know they
 really dissolve what we take for granted in terms of a coherent unitary content of consciousness
 you know if you've ever had the the synesthesia that's a can sometimes be introduced or induced by
 psychedelic drugs you will know what it's like to treasure the fact that um the color is seen
 and sound is heard um it doesn't have to be like that um you know it's just that if we as sustained
 comp uh inferring processes self-evidous in computing processes that sustain in a coherent way our
 sense making it looks as if colors are seen and sounds are heard that's how that's how we make
 sense of it doesn't have to be like that and you can experience the converse you can start to see
 sounds you can hear colors you can have a horrible distortions of type deception a moment can actually
 feel as if you've nested you know so all of these things that we take for granted in terms of our
 sense making are so fragile that you're given the right either psychopathology or pathophysiology
 technically a sign-up top of the of the kind you might associate with things like
 Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia possibly um your even neurotic disorders um
 of sort of your affective or depressive or generalized anxiety disorders can all be understood as
 basically a disintegration of this of this coherent synthesis and to use your word uh
 the binding um um which means that I think the same principles could also be ascribed to
 consciousness itself and you know I'm not sure um I mean for so depersonalization derealization I
 think are two conditions which I've never experienced but my understanding of subjective reports from
 people or how patients who have experienced these do I think really speak to this notion
 that there could be multiple consciousnesses and and of course one will not be aware of the other
 and possibly not even able to infer the agency even if it was but also there could be no
 consciousness you know I can I there are depersonalization syndromes where you still sense you still
 perceive but it's not you and there are some derealization syndromes where you are there but all your
 sisorium is unreal it's not actually there anymore you're not actually in the world so you can get
 these horrible disintegration um dissociative um well dissociative is a is a a critical term
 you can get these situations where everything we take for granted about the unitary aspect of our
 experienced world and us as experiences can so easily be dissolved in you know in these conditions
 so I I take Yash's questions very very seriously and so would people have suffered from these
 conditions I would distinguish between consciousness and self more closely than you seem to be doing
 just now I would say that consciousness coincides with the ability to dream or it is the ability
 to dream even and in schizophrenia the dream is spinning off from the tightly coupled model it
 allows you to track reality but when we dream at night we are dissociated from our uh sensorium
 and uh the brain is probably also dissociated in many other ways and as a result we get split off
 from the ability for instance to remember who we are in which city we live in what our name is
 very often in a dream even if it's a lucid dream where we get some agency over the contents of our
 dream we might might not be able to reconstruct our normal personality and uh crucial aspects of
 our own self and uh in schizophrenia I think this happens while we are awake which means we start to
 produce mental representations that look real to us but that have no longer the property that
 they are predicting what's going to happen next and about or much later and this ability to lose
 predictive power doesn't mean that they are now more of an illusion than before there's the
 normal stuff that has predictive power is still a hallucination it's still a trance state when you
 perceive something as real as long as you perceive it as real it's only uh some trance states are
 useful in the sense that they have predictive power that they use for representations and others
 are not and the ability to wake up from this uh notion that uh your representations are real is
 what megal theft calls enlightenment he's a meditation teacher was a pretty rational
 approach to enlightenment and basically to him enlightenment is the state where you recognize
 all your mental representations as representations and become aware of their representational nature
 whereas you realize that nothing that you can perceive is real because everything that you can
 perceive is a representational content and that's something that is accessible to your
 introspection uh via introspection if you build the necessary models for doing that so when your
 mind is getting to this model uh level where you can construct a representation of how you're
 representing things uh then you get some agency of how you are interacting with your representation
 but uh I wouldn't say that somebody who is uh experiencing um a schizophrenic episode and uh
 or a dear realizes or depersonalizes is losing consciousness they are losing their self they're
 losing coherence they're losing the ability to track reality and the interaction between
 self and external world and so on but uh as long as they experience that happening they're still
 conscious does this make sense mm-hmm yeah certainly in terms of altered states of
 consciousness absolutely do you know Thomas Metzinger the some of the things you've just said said the
 very reminiscent of you know his treatment of um say phenomenal opacity and the like is is he
 somebody that you have discussed these things with or subscribed if you discuss relatively
 briefly or maybe he met a few times since I left Germany only mostly uh online and uh I like Thomas
 a lot I think that he is uh one of the few German philosophers was reading right now
 but of course he's limited by being a philosopher which means he uh he is going to the point where uh
 before he stops before the point where he would make actually functional models that we could test
 right so I think his concepts are sound he does observe a lot of interesting things and I guess
 a lot of it also through introspection but I think in order to understand consciousness
 we actually need to do testable theories and I suspect even if he cannot construct consciousness
 as this strange loop as Hofstra calls it from scratch which I don't know whether we can do that
 I'm agnostic with respect to that he can probably recreate the conditions that lead to the discovery
 of consciousness in the brain which means we can initiate the search process that the brain is
 initiating before it discovers it. I was going to make the joke that we've we've offended physicists
 neuroscientists and that was the last one. Yeah it's my thing. It's mostly retaliation because I'm
 so offended by them. I shouldn't. I try to study all these things and I got so little out of it
 I found that most of it is just pretense. It's uh there's so little honest thinking going on about
 the condition that we are in uh it was very very frustrating to me. What field do you identify as
 being a part of Yosha computer scientist, cognitive scientist? Uh I I I computer science most because
 I've discovered as a student that you can publish in computer science uh at every stage of your
 career. You can be a first semester student and you can publish in computer science because the
 criteria of validity are not human criteria. The stuff either works or it doesn't. You prove it
 depends out or it doesn't. Whereas the criteria and philosophy are too much larger degree social
 criteria. So the more your peers influence the outcome of the review and the even more your peers
 uh can deviate from the actual mission of your subject in the social dynamics uh the more half
 of us that your field becomes. And so we noticed for instance in psychology we had this big replication
 crisis and the application crisis in psychology was something that was anticipated by a number
 of psychologists for many many years that pointed out this curious fact that psychology seems to be
 the only science way. You make a prediction at the beginning of your paper and it always comes true
 in the end enormous predictive power and uh also pointed at all the ways in which p-hacking was
 accepted and legal and how poorly the statistical tools were understood. And then we have this
 replication crisis and uh 15,000 studies get invalidated more or less or no longer reliable.
 And somebody uh pointed this out uh in beautiful text where they said essentially what's happening
 here is that we have uh an airplane crash and you hear that 15,000 of your loved ones have died
 and nobody even goes to the trouble to ID them because nobody cares because nothing is changing
 as a result of these invalidated studies right. What kind of the building has just toppled?
 Nobody cares there's not actually a building there's just people talking.
 And uh when this happens we have to be brutally honest I think as a as a field also I hear very
 often that uh AI has been inspired by neuroscience and learned so much from it. But when I look at
 the actual algorithms the last big influence was heavier learning. And the other stuff is just
 people talking taking inspiration taking insights and so on but it's not actually there is a lot of
 stuff that you can take out of the formalisms of um people who studied the brain and directly
 translated. I think that uh even with what Carl is doing is much more uh results of information
 theory and physics that is congruent with information theory because it's thinking about
 similar phenomena using similar mathematical tools and then expresses it with uh more Greek
 letters than the computer scientists used to do. But uh there is a big overlap in this and so I
 think the separation between intellectual traditions and fields and disciplines is something that
 we should probably overcome. We should also probably in an age of AI we think the way in which we
 publish and think right is the paper actually the contribution that we want to make in the future
 in a time where you can ask your LLM to generate the paper. It's maybe it's the building block
 the knowledge item the argument that is going to be the major contribution that the scientist
 or the team has to make the experiment. And then uh you have systems that automatically synthesize
 this into answers to the questions that you have and you want to uh do something in a particular
 kind of context. But this will completely change the way in which we evaluate value in the scientific
 institutions at the moment. And nobody knows what this is going to look like. Imagine we use an LLM
 to read a scientific paper and we parse out all the sources of the scientific paper from the paper
 and what the sources are meant to argue for. And then we automatically read all the sources and
 check whether they actually say that what the papers claiming the sources say. And we parse through
 the entire trees of a discipline in this way until we get to first principles. What are we going to
 find? Which parts of science will hold up? I think that we might be at the doorstep of a choice
 between a scientific revolution in which science becomes radically honest and changes the way it
 works or in which it reveals itself as an employment program. It's fake jobs for people who couldn't
 find a job in the real economy and basically get away because their peers let them get away with
 it. And I try to be as pointedly as possible and as bleak as possible. Science given its
 incentives that it's working under and the institutional right that has set in after
 decades of postmodernism, it's surprisingly good stuff. There's so many good scientists
 in all fields that I know. But I also noticed that many of the disciplines seem to be making a
 lot of progress for the questions that we have. And many fields seem to be stuck and this doesn't
 seem to be just because all the low-hanging fruits are wrapped. But I think it's also because the way
 in which scientific institutions works have changed, the notion of peer review probably didn't
 exist very much before the 1970s. This idea that you get truths by looking at a peer-reviewed study
 rather than asking a person who was able to read and write such studies. That is new. That is
 something that didn't exist for Einstein. And so I don't know if this means that Einstein was an
 unscientific mind that was only successful because he was working at the beginning of a discipline.
 Or it was because he was thinking at a completely different paradigm. But no matter what, I think
 that AI is going to have the potential to change the paradigm massively. And I don't know which way,
 but I can't wait. So now that we're talking about computer scientists, what do you make of
 the debacle at OpenAI, both Karl and Yoshua directed to you, Yoshua, first?
 And that's actually little I can say because I don't actually know what the reason was
 for the decision of the board to fire the CEO. Firing the CEO is one of the very
 issue moves beyond providing advice than the board can make. I thought if the board makes
 such a decision in a company in which many of the core employees have been hired by the CEO and
 have been working very closely at happily with the CEO, they will need to have a very solid case.
 And there needs to be a lot of deliberation among core engineers and players and the company
 before such a decision is being made apparently that has not been the case. I have difficulty to
 understand why people behaved in the way in which they did. The outcome is that OpenAI is more
 unified than ever. It's basically 95% agreement about employees that they are going to leave the
 company if it doesn't reinstate the CEO. It's almost unheard of. This is like an
 Eastern European communist dictatorship is fake elections, but it was not fake. It was basically
 people getting together overnight and getting signatures for a decision that greatly impacts
 their professional careers. Many of them are on visa that depend on continuous employment
 within a company, so they enter actual risks for a time. And I also suspect that a lot of the
 discussions that happened were bluffs right when the board said, yes, they want to reinstate them,
 but then Waffle then came out with MST here who is a pretty good person, but it's not
 clear why the Twitch CEO would be the right person to lead OpenAI suddenly. So I don't even know
 whether the decision was made because there were personal disagreements about communication styles
 or whether it was about the direction of the company, where members of the board felt
 that AI is going to be developed too quickly and should be slowed down significantly.
 And the strategy of Sam Altman to run chat GPT at the loss and making up for this by speeding
 up the development and getting more capital in and thereby basically creating an AGI or bus
 strategy for the company might not be the right strategy. Also the board members don't hold
 equity in the company, so this is the situation where the outcome of their decision is somewhat
 divorced from their own material incentives and it depends more aligned with their political or
 ideal ideas that they might have or the goals that they have. And again, not all of them are
 hardcore AI researchers, some of them are. I don't really know what the particular discussions
 have been in there, and of course I have more intimate speculations at some discussions with
 people at OpenAI, but I cannot disclose the speculations of course. And so at the moment,
 I can only summarize in some sense what's publicly known and what you can read on Twitter. It's super
 exciting. It has kept us all awake for a few days. It's a fascinating drama and somewhat frustrated
 by people saying, ""Oh my God, this is destroyed. Trust in OpenAI, if decisions can be so erratic,
 because OpenAI should be like a bureaucracy that is not moving in 100 years.""
 No, this is part of something that is super dynamic and is changing all the time.
 I think that what the board should probably have seen is that the best possible outcomes that I
 could have achieved is that OpenAI is going to split, that the best possible in the sense of the
 board trying to fire some outman to change the course of the company. They would have created
 one of the largest competitors to OpenAI. And so based on anti-antropic, on the other side
 of OpenAI that is focusing more on accelerating AI research, it would have been clear that many
 of the core team members would join it, and it would destroy a lot of the equity or that OpenAI
 currently possesses, and it would take away large portions of OpenAI's largest customers,
 Microsoft. So these are some observations. So Sam is back now.
 Yes, and this was clear that it would happen. This move by Satya Nadella to say he works
 now for Microsoft happened not after negotiating a new organization for a month.
 It happened in an afternoon. After it was announced that the board now has another candidate that
 they secretly got talked into taking on this role, Microsoft basically is set up as a threat.
 They're all going to come to us. Every OpenAI person who once cannot join Microsoft in a dedicated
 autonomous unit with details that are yet to be announced, but they're not going to be materially
 or worse off or research-wise worse off. So this is a backstop that Microsoft had to implement to
 prevent its stock from tumbling on Monday morning. So Microsoft moved very fast on Sunday and decided
 we are going to make sure that we are not going to create a situation that is worse for us than it
 was before. And this creates enormous pressure on OpenAI to basically decide
 either we are going to be alone without most of the core employees and without our business model,
 but having succeeded in what the board wants, or we accept the fact that the board has been
 defeated. And Sam Allen has not been entirely candid with the board when he said last June that
 the board can just fire him if it exists with him. Because that's obviously not the case,
 because the board at the moment where there's so much buy-in for the employees and the core
 investors and customers of OpenAI, they cannot just fire the CEO. This is out very good reason.
 And Karl, what do you make of it, the whole fiasco?
 I was just listening with fascination. I think you have more than enough material to keep from
 your viewers engaged. Can I discuss it? Is OpenAI going to be ingested by Microsoft or not? Do you
 think OpenAI is going to survive by itself? Some people are joking that OpenAI scores is
 to make Google obsolete to replace search by intelligence, and Google is too slow to deliver
 product to deal with this impending competition. OpenAI has rapidly growing in the last few months,
 has hired a lot of people who are focusing on product and customer relationships.
 The core research team has been growing much more conservatively,
 and I think that Microsoft was a natural partner for OpenAI in this regard,
 because Microsoft is able to make large investments and yet is possibly not as agile as Google.
 The risk that if OpenAI would partner with Google as a main customer, that Google at some point
 would just walk away with the core technology and some of the core researchers might be larger
 than with Microsoft, but they can only speculate there.
 So the last question for this podcast is, how is it that you all prevent an existential crisis
 from occurring with all this talk of the self as an illusion or our beliefs,
 which are so associated with our conception of ourselves, immutable identities,
 and competing contradictory theories of terrifying reality being entertained?
 Well, Carl.
 I'm just trying to get underneath the question. These, the kind of illusions I think we're talking
 about are the stuff of the lived world and the experienced world, and they are not weak or facile
 or facsimiles of reality, and these are the fantastic objects, belief structures that constitute
 reality. So literally, as I'm sure we've said before, the brain as a purveyor of these fantasies,
 these illusions is fantastic, literally, because it has the capacity to entertain these fantasies.
 So I don't think that there should be any worry about somehow not being accountable to reality.
 These are fantastic objects that we have created, co-created,
 you could argue, give us some of our conversations, the constitute our reality.
 I think that existential crisis is a good thing. It basically means that you are
 getting at a point where you have a transition in front of you, where you basically realize that
 the current model is not working anymore, and you need a new one. And the crisis,
 usually, existential crisis doesn't necessarily result in death. It typically results in
 transformation into something that is more sustainable and because it understands itself and its
 relationship to reality better. The fact that we have existential questions and that we want to
 have answers for them is a good thing. When I was young, I thought I don't want to understand how
 music actually works because it would remove the magic. But the more I understood how music works,
 the more appreciative I became of deeper levels of magic. And I think the same is true for our own
 minds. It's not like when we understand how it works, that it loses its magic, it just removes
 the stupidity of superstition and gives us something that shows its inner beauty and
 brilliance and allows us to make it much more sophisticated and intricate.
 Thank you, Yoshua. Thank you, Carl. There's a litany of points for myself, for the audience,
 for all of us to chew on over the course of the next few days, even maybe even weeks. Thank you.
 Thank you, Kurt, for bringing us together. Carl, I really enjoyed this conversation with you.
 It was brilliant. I liked that you'd think on your feet that we have this very deep interaction.
 I found interesting in that we agree on almost everything. We might sometimes use different
 terminology, but we seem to be looking at the same thing from pretty much the same perspective.
 And I also really enjoyed it. It was a very, very engaging conversation, and I love the way that
 you're not frightened to upset people and tell them things that say, ""Oh, I'm not looking for a
 job on academia."" Good. Neither am I, but I'd still not have your balls. Well done.
 Have a wonderful rest of the day. Thank you. All right, take care. Brilliant. Thanks very much.
 By the way, if you would like me to expand on this thesis of multiple overlapping
 consciousnesses that I had from a few years ago, let me know and I can look through my old notes.
 All right, that's a heavy note to end on. You should know, Yosha has been on this podcast
 several times, one solo, another with Ben Gourdso, another with John Verveke, another with Michael
 Levin, and one more with Donald Hoffman. Whereas Carl Friston has also been on several times,
 twice solo, another between Carl Friston and Michael Levin, and another with Carl and Anna
 Lemke. That one's coming up shortly. The links to every podcast mentioned will be in the description,
 as well as the links to any of the articles or books mentioned, as usual in every single
 theories of everything podcast are in the description. We take meticulous timestamps, and we take
 meticulous notes. If you'd like to donate because this channel has had a difficult time monetizing
 with sponsors, and sponsors are the main bread and butter of YouTube channels, then there are
 three options. There's Patreon, which is a monthly subscription, it's patreon.com/kurtjimongal.
 Again, links are in the description. There's also PayPal for one-time sums. If you like,
 it's also a place where you can donate monthly. There's a custom way of doing so,
 and the amount that goes to the creator, a.k.a. meat in this case, is greater on PayPal than on
 Patreon, because PayPal takes less of a cut. There's also cryptocurrency, if you're more
 familiar with that, and the links to all of these are in the description. I'll say them
 aloud in case you're away from the screen. It's tinyurl.com/lowercase, all of this is lowercase,
 P-A-Y-P-A-L, so PayPal, but then uppercase tell, T-O-E, uppercase. And then for crypto,
 it's tinyurl.com/lowercase, C-R-Y-P-T-O, capital T-O-E. I just recommend you look to the description
 and click there in case you enter in something wrong, and there's someone that's trying to fish
 a different account. Thank you. Thank you for your support. It helps tell, continue to run.
 It helps pay for the editor who's doing this right now. I and my wife are extremely grateful
 for your support. We wouldn't be able to do this without you. Thank you.
 The podcast is now concluded. Thank you for watching. If you haven't subscribed or clicked that like
 button, now would be a great time to do so, as each subscribe and like helps you to push this
 content to more people. You should also know that there's a remarkably active discord and
 subreddit for theories of everything where people explicate toes disagree respectfully about theories
 and build as a community our own toes. Links to both are in the description. Also, I recently
 found out that external links count plenty toward the algorithm, which means that when you share on
 Twitter, on Facebook, on Reddit, et cetera, it shows YouTube that people are talking about this
 outside of YouTube, which in turn greatly aids the distribution on YouTube as well.
 Last but not least, you should know that this podcast is on iTunes. It's on Spotify. It's on
 every one of the audio platforms. Just type in theories of everything and you'll find it.
 Often I gain from rewatching lectures and podcasts and I read that in the comments. Hey,
 total listeners also gain from replaying. So how about instead of re listening on those platforms?
 iTunes, Spotify, Google podcasts, whichever podcast catcher you use. If you'd like to support more
 conversations like this, then do consider visiting patreon.com/kurtjimongal and donating with whatever
 you like. Again, it's support from the sponsors and you that allow me to work on toe full-time.
 You get early access to ad-free audio episodes there as well. For instance, this episode was
 released a few days earlier. Every dollar helps far more than you think. Either way,
 your viewership is generosity enough.

 be outdated?
 I guess what does it take to have a culture that enables that in the meeting?
 Because that's a very uncomfortable thing to bring up at a meeting.
 We all show up here at the Friday.
 This is such...
 You have just asked a million dollar question.
 If I generalize what you're asking, you're talking in general about truth-telling.
 We humans are not really truth-seeking animals.
 We are social animals.
 Take you back in time 10,000 years and you're in a small village.
 If you go along to get along, you can survive.
 You can procreate.
 If you're the village truth-teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night.
 Truths are often...
 They don't want to be heard because important truths can be uncomfortable.
 They can be awkward.
 They can be exhausting.
 Impolite.
 Yes.
 All that kind of stuff.
 Challenging.
 They can make people defensive, even if that's not the intent.
 But any high-performing organization, whether it's a sports team, a business, a political
 organization, an activist group, I don't care what it is.
 Any high-performing organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth-telling.
 One of the things you have to do is you have to talk about that and you have to talk about
 the fact that it takes energy to do that.
 You have to talk to people, you have to remind people it's okay that it's uncomfortable.
 Literally, tell people it's not what we're designed to do as humans.
 It's kind of a side effect, we can do that.
 But it's not how we survive.
 We mostly survive by being socially animals and being cordial and cooperative.
 That's really important.
 There's a science that's all about truth-telling.
 It's actually a very formal mechanism for trying to tell the truth.
 Even in science, you find that it's hard to tell the truth.
 Even if you're supposed to have a hypothesis and test it and find data and reject the hypothesis
 and so on, it's not easy.
 But even in science, there's the senior scientist and the junior scientist, and then there's
 a hierarchy of humans, where the most seniority matters in the scientific process.
 That's true inside companies too.
 You want to set up your culture so that the most junior person can overrule the most senior
 person if they have data.
 That really is about trying to...
 There are little things you can do.
 For example, in every meeting that I attend, I always speak last.
 I know from experience that if I speak first, even very strong-willed, highly intelligent,
 high judgment participants in that meeting will wonder if Jeff thinks that I came in this
 meeting thinking one thing, but maybe I'm not right.
 You can do little things like if you're the most senior person in the room, go last, but
 everybody else goes first.
 In fact, ideally, let's try to have the most junior person go first and try to go in order
 of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion in a kind of unfiltered way because
 we really do.
 We actually literally change our opinions.
 If somebody who you really respect says something makes you change your mind a little.
 So you're saying implicitly or explicitly give permission for people to have a strong
 opinion that as long as it's backed by data?
 Yes.
 Sometimes it can even...
 By the way, a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches.
 They turn out to be based on anecdotes, they're intuition based, and sometimes you don't even
 have strong data, but you may know the personal enough to trust their judgment.
 You may feel yourself leaning in.
 It may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have, and then you may be able to say, ""Something
 about that feels right.
 Let's go collect some data on that.
 Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right.
 But for now, let's not disregard it because it feels right.""
 You can also fight inherent bias.
 There's an optimism bias.
 If there are two interpretations of a new set of data, and one of them is happy and one
 of them is unhappy, it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation
 is right.
 You may want to compensate for that human bias of looking for trying to find the silver
 lighting, and say, ""Look, that might be good, but I'm going to go with it's bad for now
 until we're sure.""

 I mean, his view of Twitter, he often says it,
 it's like the town square.
 That we need to protect the free speech there.
 But Twitter is not the town square.
 I mean, Tristan Harris recently said
 that Twitter is actually the town's gladiator arena,
 not the town square.
 Town square rewards a moderate talk, rational talk
 discussion that tries to lead to consensus.
 And Twitter is more like a gladiator arena
 that rewards extremism, that rewards rage.
 And you don't even fight there against other humans.

 is that we've allowed the skills of disagreeing well to atrophy.
 We no longer view argument as a skill and as something to be worked at.
 Rather, we see it as something we jump into out of instinct or defensiveness.
 Why is our world so divided right now?
 It's like we're in this vast sea of identity.
 A singular identity and it's really hard to locate who we are.
 The moment we feel threatened, we tend to move back to this fundamental primal
 sense of belonging that I call triumphs.
 I believe that our world is becoming more and more a tribal world.
 When people disagree, they literally have the capacity to listen to 10 seconds
 of what the other side has to say.
 10 seconds, that's three sentences.
 And by then, they already are busy creating their regretful.
 You're saying the same thing over and over again.
 And I'm saying the same thing over and over again.
 And those two never meet.
 And the more I say kicks, the more I make you say why.
 It's me who is reinforcing you saying the fundamental thing with which you disagree with.
 [MUSIC]
 Thomas Hobbs took a pretty pessimistic view, not only of disagreements,
 but the kinds of people we become when we engage in disagreements.
 He believed that these petty disputes can grow into a kind of a conflagration
 that brings down not only relationships, but also nations.
 And this was a man who lived through periods of war.
 And so he saw the destructive force that arguments can be.
 And looking at all that damage, he concluded that the appropriate response
 was to take on a posture of civil silence towards one another.
 That we wouldn't engage in these disagreements.
 That we would grin and bear to tolerate one another's differences.
 The problem with that is our commonalities are only one part of the fullness of our relationship
 with one another.
 A life built just around agreement is an impoverished life.
 Because it requires taking away and ignoring that variety is a source of challenge.
 It's the way in which we piece together truth from different perspectives.
 It's the way in which we go beyond ourselves.
 Arguments are easy to start and hard to end.
 Because difference is the natural state of things.
 How do we disagree better?
 Every disagreement should start with a little bit of agreement.
 There are any number of differences between two people.
 And when one of those issues comes to the fore, you can have a disagreement.
 But unless you're selective about the kinds of arguments that you pick.
 And unless you're careful to say we're having this disagreement at this moment
 and not all the other disagreements we could be having.
 All of the differences between two people can start flooding in.
 And the argument becomes this unruly mass and you're not making progress on any given one.
 All relationships are colored with expectations.
 About myself and about the other.
 My expectations influence that which I then see or hear.
 It is a filter as well as my mood is a filter.
 We in communication have the ability to set the other people up
 because we will draw from them the very things which we expect from them.
 Even when it's the opposite of what we really want.
 We create the others in relationships and in communication.
 It isn't just that's who they are and that's who we are.
 It's how people actually co-create each other in the context of a relationship.
 And why we are not the same person with different people.
 Because those people make part of who we are.
 When we are in conflictual relationships we will often be prone to negative attributions.
 Which is that when you speak to me a certain way it's because
 you have a bad temper or you have a nasty personality.
 When I speak to you in a certain way it's because I had a lot of traffic
 getting here this morning and because I'm having a bad day.
 You are a bad person. I have just bad circumstances.
 I essentialize you and I contextualize me.
 When it comes to emotionally charged conflict why is it so hard to listen?
 Because my identity is feeling threatened.
 You're not just attacking some cerebral ideas I have.
 You are attacking my value system.
 The moment our identity feels threatened all of a sudden we fall prey to a mindset.
 A dangerous mindset that I call the tribe's effect.
 Once you attach to a tribe something strange happens.
 No longer is content as important the substance of the argument.
 This is an us versus them way of thinking.
 Now I want to move toward being with a group of people like myself
 who are going to protect me and my interests from becoming trampled.
 So I will argue and defend my perspective to no ends
 but I am going to close my ears to your perspective.
 So much of debate is an exercise in certainty.
 It's about spending sometimes weeks researching your side of the case
 coming up with the best possible arguments that you can.
 Coming up with the best lines that you can to sell the truth of your side to the listener.
 But in the last moments before a debate goes on stage
 they know to take a breath, to take out a new sheet of paper
 and to put themselves in their opponent's shoes
 and write the four best arguments for the opposing side.
 They know also to look over their case again
 this time through the eyes of someone who fervently disagrees with them
 and to identify all of the flaws and the mistakes
 and the criticisms that could be leveled against them.
 Debate is also known to imagine a world in which they lost the debate
 and to come up with the reasons why they did.
 Those exercises which are called the side switch exercises
 puts a pause on that feeling of certainty.
 It makes us feel for a moment the subjective reasonableness of other people's beliefs.
 It gives us that moment where we get back on our toes and think maybe we missed something.
 It makes us imagine a world in which we're wrong or at least we're judged to be wrong.
 And all of that isn't humility, isn't empathy in and of itself
 but it creates a wriggle room through which something like humility or empathy might arise.
 What is lacking is the ability to see that speaking is entirely dictated
 by the quality of the listening that is reflected back on us.
 Maybe you can acknowledge the validity of my point of view.
 That doesn't mean you agree with my point of view but my point of view makes sense.
 And potentially you may even empathize with my point of view.
 You can understand why I would think or feel or experience things the way I do.
 That reflecting back, acknowledging, validating, empathizing.
 That sequence is where the depth of communication takes place.
 Shift that dynamic so it's no longer me versus you.
 Instead it's the two of us sitting side by side together facing the same shared problem.
 It's my ability to take in what you say, to mull it over, to include it in my response
 so that I make you feel that you matter, that what you say makes a difference,
 that you're not just talking to the wind.
 Because ultimately if I speak to you and in the end I leave feeling even more alone,
 I am literally in an existential crisis.
 There is nothing worse than to be alone in the presence of another.
 Where the conflict of a person and the highly combative person meet is in their shared desire
 for a connection.
 And it's a connection that they don't get just by persisting in their most natural modes.
 You can't connect if the only grounds on which you connect with another person
 or you reach out to another person is similarity rather than difference.
 And similarly you can't connect if your whole desire is to
 dominate or to show yourself to be superior than the other person.
 Every human contains both of these instincts within them.
 The middle ground where good arguments stem from is from a recognition that
 it's through connection with others, it's through an encounter with others
 that we get more than we would be able to on our own.

 of carrying out the high and low-level tasks involved in research, what would we need to
 do differently from what we have today, how would systems need to differ from the ones
 we have today, what components would we need, and how would we build such a system?
 In an error sense, but we technically need to do, I think, as a system that is able to
 edit and extend this embedding space, so it can build new representations over the world.
 Second, is to be able to test them both empirically and from first principles.
 And third, it needs to be an author, which means it learns from what it finds out and
 changes as a result, so it's constantly expanding, it's horizon, and understands things.
 But this is based on an extremely idealist notion of what a scientist is.
 I mean, when I was a grad student, I told my professor what I wanted to do before my PhD,
 and I said, basically, I want to take something like Minsky's Society of Mind and get it closer
 to something that I can actually implement, and my professor told me this is not what
 a scientist does.
 This is not possible in science.
 In science, you need to find a project that you can sell to a grant agency that gives
 results in three years from now, and when you do something where you, as you say, are fine
 when you don't succeed in your life, because it's too hard, this is not science today.
 Science today is quite different, but a scientist is doing is successfully publishing impactful
 papers.
 It's the working definition of a scientist in today's world.
 It's the idea that scientist is a lifestyle archetype is completely confused.
 That's not what it's for.
 A scientist is a very specific and not very satisfying job, except for very, very few
 people.
 Also, in the process of generating knowledge, the scientist has a very specific and very
 narrow role.
 It's the thing where you are assigning control groups, where you're going through lots and
 lots of Excel tables and do very boring experiments, very systematically engage in very detailed
 discourses, and there is more that you need to do when you want to understand.
 Before you can do science, you need to do engineering.
 You need to get something to work at all.
 Science in some sense is a much more systematized version of engineering, where you are getting
 the last crumbs out of the system where you understand the entire space, whereas the engineer
 just tries to get it to work.
 Before you can engineer, you need to design, and the designer is somebody who gets the
 thing to work for just one person from one single perspective.
 Before you can do design, you need an artist.
 You can see at first what the problem is, who can observe the reality deeply and capture
 what they observe.
 This entire process from observation to the systematization is what we want to do.
 It's something that in our institutions, we normally don't do very much anymore, because
 we are all extreme specialists, and the observers and the modelers are in different schools,
 and rarely talk to each other.
 To me, this project of building an artificial scientist is very exciting, because it would
 require us to not just build a system that is able to write papers, which I think is
 going to be over soon.
 What do you think is going to happen when somebody has the idea to use JetGPT to read
 through the paper repositories, write out all the references, and what the references
 are supposed to say, and then read the source papers and compare whether it's the case,
 and build the entire tree.
 This is going to be an earthquake.
 It's going to be much bigger than the replication crisis in psychology.
 It's going to change the notion that we have of papers as the artifact of science, as the
 main way in which we measure our progress in success as scientists.
 When we are building artificial scientists, the artifact is going to be different.
 It's probably not being the paper.
 It's going to be some building block in a larger amount of understanding that you can
 interrogate using AI, and then use a very different context.
 This would be very exciting, basically to transcend what science is today and turn it
 into something that is much, much more useful than what we currently do.

 ""In the early 21st century, largely thanks to the global liberal order, humanity has experienced the most peaceful and prosperous era in history. That era is now over.""
 So, what changed since then?
 Ukraine, Sudan, Israel.
 Experts say we are witnessing a cascade of wars.
 ""The number of war casualties worldwide is increasing.""
 ""We all feel pain. We all love our children, our spouses, our parents.""
 ""So instead of fighting each other, we should work towards our shared interests.""
 ""This was the simple idea behind the global liberal order.""
 ""Okay, stop. Global liberal order. What's that?""
 After the Second World War, the U.S. set up a complex system of alliances and institutions.
 The U.S. is the by far strongest military and economy, safeguards global stability.
 ""One unshakable unity of determination to find a way to end war.""
 [Applause]
 Members, states commit to universal and liberal values. They cooperate in promoting human rights in free trade.
 And they stop fighting wars of conquest.
 ""Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great power is no longer fight world wars.""
 Now, the global liberal order was far from perfect, had many, many problems.
 And this order was attacked and destroyed.
 And when there is no order, what you get is this order, chaos, violence, and it's spreading.
 The system isn't working anymore. But why? Two theories about that are all over the scientific debate, populism and polarity.
 [Music]
 The theory of polarity explains how many countries are powerful enough to influence world politics to their own desires.
 In a multipolar system, three or more countries are trying to achieve just that. On their own, they are in balance.
 Alliances can plunge the system into chaos.
 The consequence? The 30 years war, the 9 years war, the 7 years war, the Napoleonic War, World War I, World War II.
 In a bipolar system, two more or less equally powerful countries are facing each other, esturing the Cold War.
 In theory, it's the most stable system.
 In reality, though, the bipolar order led to a whole array of proxy wars.
 As in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan.
 Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. were the sole superpower in a unipolar system,
 which brings us back to the present and the global liberal order.
 But, according to experts, this order has three fatal flaws.
 The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan proved that not even the U.S. military might can enforce sustainable regime change.
 Growing parts of the populations and Western democracies reacted with nationalism to refugees from North Africa and the Middle East.
 And the consequences of a globalized economy, while China rose, the U.S. and Europe saw increasing job losses and income inequality.
 All three led to a rise in populism.
 How exactly does populism attack the world order?
 This day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.
 It's always about a strong leader, who supposedly has to protect the nation from outsiders.
 To do so, civil society, the justice system, and media need to be restricted.
 We have been ruled for close to 14 years by a populist strongman, Benjamin Netanyahu,
 who built his career on dividing the nation against itself.
 If you vote for populist strongmen who divide society and dismantle the state, this is the danger.
 That when you need the state most, they will no longer be there.
 The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
 From the UN Human Rights Council.
 In the mind of populists, any global cooperation is almost like treason.
 Alright, we got the theories, but how does that explain the wars?
 The U.S. are still the economic, technological and military powerhouse of the world.
 But are they still an uncontested, unipolar power?
 Many think we've already been living in a less stable, multipolar world for a long time.
 The trade influence of the EU, China's great power ambition, the potential of India's population,
 but also climate change and migration might be counted as a poll nowadays.
 We are definitely for many years, no longer in the unipolar world.
 In some respects, the rise of new powers is not a bad thing.
 It's good if a new powers like India, like Brazil receive a greater say about world affairs.
 Now if you have some alternative idea, you don't like the liberal order.
 You don't like liberal values.
 But you do have some alternative set of values and norms that is not true only for your country,
 that can serve as universal values for the whole human community.
 Okay, let's hear the alternative.
 But simply to attack the universal liberal values and institutions without replacing with them with anything,
 this is a recipe for a global disaster.
 Some argue that the Trump style of populism has shifted the attention of the US from a global to an inward focus.
 Further, that the war in Ukraine has distracted the United States from preventing other conflicts.
 And third, the increasing violence from states like Azerbaijan, militaries in the Zayel region,
 or from the Hamas terrorists would show that they don't fear the US military might no more.
 We are sliding back to the jungle.
 The global liberal order is in disarray, if not in collapse.
 It is replaced by chaos and violence.
 The international system is showing fragmentation.
 Free trade deals fail.
 Autographed like Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan in P.D. unity in NATO.
 In the UN General Assembly, actual allies are not voting alongside each other anymore.
 Worldwide, indexes for globalization, free trade and democratization are stagnating or falling.
 The global liberal order seems to be less and less global, liberal and orderly.
 We control this planet, not because individually we are so smart or so good,
 but because we know how to cooperate better than any other entity on the planet,
 better than chimpanzees or better than viruses.
 This is our secret of success.
 If we forget it, on the level of a nation or on the level of the entire species,
 and fall into more and more internal and international conflicts,
 it's not just the regional wars in the Middle East.
 It's the threat of a third world war.
 It's climate change and ecological collapse.
 It's the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence.
 We need global cooperation on that.
 If we cannot do that, then humanity has very little chance of surviving the challenges of the 21st century.
 Thank you.
 - Thank you.

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. This may sound like
 old Sabina has finally gone completely crazy, fair enough. But I believe my worries aren't
 quite as crazy as they sound, though I guess that's exactly what a crazy person would say,
 wouldn't they? Crazy or not, I think it's worth discussing. Why might science end? And is it
 happening? That's what we'll talk about today. In 1996, John Horgan wrote a book called The End
 of Science, in which he made a case that science has come to a halt and isn't going to stop moving
 again. It made him not so surprising the enemy number one of scientists, because it's not funny
 to have the end of your profession prophesied in a best-selling book if your income comes mostly
 from the taxes of people who buy those books. But Horgan isn't want to back down. In 2016,
 20 years after the book was first published, he wrote a new preface saying that for all he can see
 he was right. Horgan's claim wasn't that we'd stop doing science, but rather in his own words,
 that there'd be no great revelations or revolutions anymore, no insights into nature as
 cataclysmic as heliocentrism, evolution, quantum mechanics, relativity, or the Big Bang.
 And he's indeed been right, hasn't he? Just look at physics. All the big questions that were
 unanswered 40 years ago are still unanswered today. We still don't know what dark matter is,
 how to quantize gravity, or how the universe started. And it's true in all other scientific
 disciplines too. We still don't know how life began, what consciousness is, how to become immortal,
 and we still don't know why socks disappear in washing machines. I have a weekly science news show
 and the science news letter, and it might seem like I'd be the last person in the world to agree
 with Horgan, but I think he has a point. He wasn't even the first to raise the issue. I came across
 this first in a book by John Barrow called Impossibility. Barrow had a logically very compelling argument.
 He said, knowledge about the loss of nature is either finite or it isn't, and we'll either find
 out all there is to know, or we won't. If the knowledge is infinite and we're really good at
 figuring it out, science will go on forever. But if the knowledge is either finite or we have a
 finite capacity for figuring it out, we'll reach a limit. We have no way of knowing what we don't
 know, so it's a real possibility that science will end, and the question is just when.
 There is some ambiguity here on who or what we means. Maybe you and I aren't going to figure out
 all of science, certainly not if we keep spending all our time on YouTube, but we might mean a new
 kind of species that humans evolve into, or humans with brain implants, or humans with the help of
 artificial intelligence, or maybe we'll carry around spare brains in backpacks. But regardless
 of how we might expand our minds, that still remains the question whether we can indefinitely
 expand our knowledge, or whether there's a limit. Horgan's claim is stronger than Barrow's.
 Barrow's just said science could end. Horgan says we've reached the end already. According
 to Horgan, the discovery of the laws of nature was a temporary phase in human development,
 and it's over. Just like the exploration of Earth's surface, or that of human anatomy,
 there is a time when big discoveries happen, then that time ends. This isn't to say that
 cartography or the study of the human body is finished, and neither is the further study of
 nature in other areas. NASA, for example, is making more and more precise measurements of the
 surface of Earth by scanning it with lasers, measuring even the height and depth of forests,
 and the minute changes in gravitational pull from varying surface densities. But no one's going to
 discover a new continent, and we're continuing to explore the human body, finding new ways to
 fix things, like bridging damaged nerves. But no one's going to find an extra brain underneath
 the left kneecap. The age of big discoveries in those areas is over for good. And this raises the
 question, will the same thing happen with science in its entirety? Was the discovery of new laws of
 nature just a phase in our history that's passed? I think it's a possibility that we need to
 seriously consider. But most scientists, I think, dismiss Horgan's worry, and to be fair,
 physicists in particular have a good reason to dismiss the end of science. That's because physics
 has a lot of big, open problems that we know require a solution, like what's with all those
 observations that are usually attributed to dark matter. Is it some kind of particle that we have
 yet detected? Or do we misunderstand gravity? Our current theories can't explain it,
 yet it's happening out there. And there is the missing quantization of gravity. That's the
 incompatibility between Einstein's general relativity and quantum physics. The easiest way to see
 that there has to be some solution to this is that we just don't know what the gravitation of
 field of a particle is when it's in two places at once. Einstein's theory can't handle that.
 And what's with the measurement problem in quantum mechanics? Sooner or later, we'll need a
 solution to that, something that tells us just exactly when a device has the right properties to
 act as detector. Horgan thinks we'll never answer these questions. Now, I've worked on all those
 topics, and I think they are solvable with currently existing mathematics and technology.
 But maybe he's right, and I'm wrong. That said, there's another reason why I don't think
 we're anywhere close to reaching the end of science, and it's nothing to do with physics.
 It's a research area that Horgan cheerfully dismissed as kialplexity, the study of chaos and
 complexity. That's the whole story with the butterfly effect and self-organized adaptive systems and
 all that. Chaos and complexity were big buzzwords in the 1980s, and it's true that not much came
 out of it. So you might say, ""Ha, Horgan's right."" Well, maybe, but I think the reason that this
 research didn't get very far is that we haven't developed the mathematics for it. And there are
 big breakthroughs waiting to happen once we have the maths in place. You see, I'd say that physics
 uses the most sophisticated maths of all the sciences. But if you look at it from a bird's eye
 perspective, it's really rudimentary. We only know how to solve certain types of equations,
 so-called linear differential equations. But most of the interesting phenomena in nature,
 like chaos and complexity, require nonlinear equations, and we don't have a good method
 of solving those. Believe it or not, but the best tried and tested method to solve nonlinear
 differential equations is guessing a solution and then checking that it's correct. Sometimes
 it works, sometimes it doesn't. Now, we can put nonlinear differential equations on a computer,
 and that's what we do, for example, in general relativity. The nonlinear equations in this case
 are Einstein's field equations. There are nonlinear differential equations for the metric tensor.
 That's this G. You can't see it very well in this form, but this R here. That's a sum
 of components of the curvature tensor, and the curvature tensor contains sums over products of
 the metric and its derivatives, so it's nonlinear. It's a really nasty set of equations. We can
 put them on a computer, but there's a catch. Computers use a finite resolution, a grid,
 basically, and discrete steps in time. Yes, you can use an adaptive mesh and other fancy things,
 but no matter what you do, computer simulations always rely on the idea that you can ignore details
 on small scales. The trouble is, for nonlinear equations, you can't do that. It's one of the
 butterfly factors all about. It's a small change, the flap of a tiny butterfly, that has huge consequences
 like a tornado in Texas. So, yes, we can put Einstein's equations on a computer, but strictly
 speaking, we don't know that what we're doing is correct. It's a similar problem with climate models.
 Yeah, I know one ought not talk about shortcomings of climate models, but I think we should. Climate
 models for the atmosphere and oceans ultimately solve the Navier-Stokes equation. That's a nonlinear
 differential equation, and we don't understand how to solve it, not really. You don't need to take
 my word for it. It's one of the 10 millennium problems in mathematics. Some people, but not you,
 I'm sure, might want to spin what I just said into a story, saying there have been things climate
 models are all wrong. This is not what I said. I said climate models are struggling with some
 things, and incorporating what happens on short scales is one of those things. Climate scientists
 have developed tools to deal with that, for example, by adding random fluctuations on the short scales,
 and that's good from the perspective of developing a predictive model, but from the perspective
 of mathematical understanding, it's extremely unsatisfactory. But back to the end of science.
 We're missing the mass to deal with nonlinear systems, systems that display chaos,
 systems that develop complexity. We don't even have a proper definition for complexity.
 It's probably the biggest gap in science right now, and it's the major reason I think science is
 nowhere near ending. We're missing a law of nature that explains how and under what circumstances
 complexity arises. There have been a couple of attempts at it. Curiously enough, just a few weeks
 ago, several papers appeared who had it go at it. They're all based on the idea of finding a way
 to quantify the growth of complexity. So far, I don't find any of those new laws of nature
 terribly convincing. But then again, my idea of a complex problem is saying no to a dinner
 invitation, so maybe I'm not the right person to ask. But for the purpose of today's video,
 it isn't all that relevant whether any of those proposed new complexity laws is right. The relevant
 point is that there quite plausibly is such a law. Scientists are on it, and if they found it,
 that'd be a really big deal. Think of all the cases where understanding chaos and complexity
 would have an impact. The stock market, nuclear fusion, society by large, the origin of life,
 saying no to dinner invitations. It's all about the growth of complexity. This is why I dare to say
 we've barely begun with science. We've done quite well in the microscopic and macroscopic regime,
 particle physics and cosmology. Yeah, it's worked fine because both are mathematically simple.
 But look at things like biological systems, life, consciousness, society and politics.
 We don't have the maths. Okay, so there are almost certainly new laws of nature left to discover
 in the mesoscopy range when complexity and chaos come into play and quite possibly artificial
 intelligence is going to help us discover them. But I think we might be reaching the end of science,
 nevertheless. Here's why. Think back of Paris argument. There are two reasons why science can
 end. It may be because there's nothing more to discover. And I just told you why I think that's
 not the case. But there's another reason. There may be natural laws left to discover
 we're just too dumb to figure them out. I don't mean that we're too dumb in the technical sense
 that we can't work out the maths or develop a computer program to do it for us. I think we're
 too dumb to organize scientific research so that scientists can efficiently work towards those
 solutions. And ironically, the reason we don't manage to smartly organize science is that we
 don't understand complex systems in the first place. So it becomes a chicken and egg problem.
 We don't understand complexity because scientific research is a complex system
 that we need to understand complexity. Okay, you might say I followed you so far,
 kind of. But why does it even matter? It matters because we put a lot of faith in scientific
 and technological progress to fix the problems we've got ourselves into. Climate change, pandemics,
 overpopulation, poverty, the threat of nuclear war. Or too often, we believe that more science and
 better technologies will come to our help. But well, what if they don't? Then we're in deep shit.
 So is science finished? It might be if we don't pay enough attention to keeping it alive.
 Maybe you will never discover all laws of nature, but if you want to discover at least the ones
 that we have found so far, Brilliant.org is the best place to start. Brilliant offers courses on
 a large variety of topics and science and mathematics. Don't know what a differential equation is?
 There's a course for that. Need to brush up your knowledge on linear algebra? There's a course
 for that. Special relativity, quantum computing, solar panels, neural nets, brilliant as you covered.
 I really like Brilliant because it's such a fun and easy way of learning. All their courses
 are interactive with follow-up questions. You learn to solve problems and build your skills
 gradually. I found their courses to be very carefully and skillfully designed to build up
 knowledge. And the nice thing about using Brilliant is that you can do it whenever and wherever you
 find the time. I even worked together with Brilliant on a course about quantum mechanics.
 It's a beginner's course that'll introduce you to the essentials. You learn what a way
 function is and how it relates to probabilities, what interferences and why it's important,
 what superpositions and entanglement are, and what the uncertainty principle means. And after that,
 you're well-prepared to continue maybe with their course on quantum objects.

You can't do it because if you are only talking
 about how the Israeli Defense Forces are responsible for these brutal killings or if you're only
 talking about what Hamas did on October 7th and you don't talk about the broader context, right?
 You are absolutely not understanding what's happening in this war right now.
 Today on Big Think we're going to be talking to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Durese Group
 and GZERO Media about the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Ian, thank you so much for
 joining us today. That's great to be back with Big Think. This region has been embroiled in
 turmoil for thousands of years so there's many historical factors we could discuss but I would
 like to know from your standpoint is it more helpful to focus on recent history to better
 understand this conflict? Both the Jews and the Palestinians have long, long running and legitimate
 claims to live on this territory. Palestinians, some 700,000 plus were kicked off these territories
 after 1948 post Holocaust. The Jews had lived on these territories for millennia
 and a number of empires have kicked them off. We can talk about that. There are people that are
 far more expert on those histories than I am but the reality is that for the Jews
 and the Palestinians that are fighting over this land today, they've been living there
 for their lifetimes and so it's really not about who has a right to live on the territory.
 It's rather that they need to find a way to live together in peace and what has happened
 over the past years is that everyone in the world has basically given up on finding
 a peaceful solution because they've tried for decades. It's too hard or because they're not
 interested. They have other things that they would rather do. That's where we are today.
 The last time that the Americans who are not an honest broker for peace in the region,
 the United States, a principal ally in the entire Middle East is Israel. You can't say,
 ""Oh, well, they're the ones that can broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians because
 they're equally trusted."" That's not true but they do have the dominant military presence in the
 region and they also have the dominant diplomatic capability on the region. They've been the ones
 that have played the most significant role and the last time an American senior diplomat was
 really invested on trying to figure out a way to bring peace to this region was when John Kerry
 was Secretary of State in the first couple of years of the Obama administration and he did
 shuttle diplomacy between the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Jordanians, the Egyptians,
 I mean all the time for 18 months, this was his top priority. He wanted a Nobel Peace Prize for it.
 He failed and after that, basically the Americans gave up. It was the pivot to Asia.
 It was no longer focusing as much on the Middle East and then when the Russians invade Ukraine,
 it's focusing on Europe too. But no one spending real time on the Palestinians,
 the Gulf states who had been providing so much money for humanitarian support for Palestinians
 living in the West Bank and particularly Gaza as well as refugees and other places. They were
 saying there could be no peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinian-Israel issue is resolved.
 Well, it turned out they were willing to make peace with Israel. They're willing to engage
 open diplomatic relations, allow Jewish tourists to come to their country, trade and investment,
 technology cooperation, security cooperation. But what about the Palestinians? Well, too hard
 to resolve and Israel, and particularly this far-right Netanyahu-led government,
 has been willing to not only expand illegally the settlements in the West Bank, reducing
 the territory that the Palestinians can live on and making it harder for them to get to work,
 go to school, have a possibility for a viable future, but also Netanyahu's government was
 engaging more with Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian Authority because they never
 wanted to pursue a two-state solution. So they forgot about the Palestinians too.
 So when you look at everyone around the world that was committed to the Palestinians finding a way
 to live viably on their territories, the answer is this has not been a priority for anyone
 for a long, long time. And their own government in the West Bank that recognizes Israel's right
 to exist as opposed to Hamas, which does not, they were corrupt, they were divided, they couldn't speak
 for Palestinians in Gaza, and they were being weakened by the Israeli government. So I mean,
 this was a long introduction to talk about the history, but the point is that if you're looking
 for people that are responsible historically for why we are in the mess that we are in today,
 and it is an unholy mess, and I use that term very literally, you know, you can look everywhere,
 and you have people to blame. That is where we are today.
 Thank you for that. I'm curious, you know, to talk about some of the domestic politics within
 Israel, because that's something that I think has not been paid enough attention to, and specifically
 the actions of the Netanyahu government and the people who they are partnering with as it relates
 to this conflict, but also just internally inside of Israel. What does it look like in terms of the
 partnerships and the dynamics that are happening there? What has been the lead up to this conflict
 in terms of the internal politics with Israel, and how has that had an effect on just the general
 relationship between Israel and the Palestinians in the various places? You know, Israel is a very
 political society. The average Israeli citizen reads a lot about news and politics. If you go to a
 cafe in Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem or Hitzelah, you're going to hear a lot of people talking about
 politics. It's also a very fragmented society. There are a lot of different political parties,
 and in order to get a government together in the Knesset, you can't govern by yourself,
 because you'd never get a majority. You have to find a coalition with other partners,
 and Netanyahu, who has, you know, faced all sorts of internal corruption scandals,
 and whose Likud party has also been painted with a lot of those challenges.
 The only way he could form a government this last time around was with a hard right group,
 a party that specifically has, you know, said some of the most horrible things about wanting
 Palestinians removed from the West Bank, about wanting to take over their territories in some
 ways. The hard right partners of Netanyahu have been as unyielding and aggressive about the
 Palestinians not having rights in the occupied territories as Hamas has been about the Jews
 not having the right to have an Israeli state. Now, that does not reflect the opinions of the
 Israeli people as a whole, but it has meant that before the events of October 7, the terrorist
 events against the people of Israel, you had enormous domestic instability. That domestic instability
 was the people of Israel revolting against Netanyahu attempting to change a very strong
 independent judiciary of that country to basically report to the executive and report to whoever
 was in charge in the Knesset. And the reason for that? More control for Netanyahu and his coalition
 and the ability to avoid getting charged and jailed for these corruption scandals and investigations
 that are ongoing. And for months, the news in Israel had nothing to do with Hamas, had nothing to do
 with the Palestinians in Gaza. It instead was about a potential constitutional crisis
 that was pending in Israel, that Israel's legitimacy as a democracy in the Middle East
 was under threat, not because of what they were doing to the Palestinians, but because of what
 Netanyahu was doing to the country, to the balance of power in Israel. So that was, they were taking
 their eye off the ball. The other thing that happened is the hard right part of the Israeli
 government was doing everything possible to expand their territorial influence in the West Bank
 and the Palestinians living there were angry and there were a lot of clashes, there were violent
 reprisals, and the Israeli defense forces, some of the best in the world, incredibly well-trained,
 high morale, while a lot of them had been sent to the West Bank and to the border zone inside Israel
 proper in an effort to contain and respond to that violence. Where were they in Gaza?
 Not worried about Gaza. Netanyahu was providing Hamas in Gaza with more resources, with more money,
 with more ability to have work visas to come on over into Israel. Why? Because they were just
 focused on governance. According to Netanyahu, they just wanted to rebuild Gaza because he
 wanted a stronger Hamas to weaken the Palestinian Authority. So what happened is you took one of the
 world's best-trained, most effective defense forces, intelligence forces, security forces,
 border forces, and you had them focusing on everything but a terrorist organization
 that was running Gaza with a people that had abysmal economic conditions, life conditions,
 half of them without enough food to eat 90% of them without access to clean water.
 And everyone is now talking about how Israel has a right to self-defense. They have a right
 to be able to defend their borders, and that is absolutely true. But that right did not begin
 after October 7th. That right existed before October 7th, and the prime minister of Israel
 and his hard right government failed the Israeli people. They did not defend their country. They
 didn't defend their borders. They weren't concerned with or focused on the real threats
 that were right there just on the south of Israel that wanted to destroy everything that the Israeli
 people have been building since 1948. So the Israeli people want Netanyahu out. They overwhelmingly
 blame him and his government for the events of October 7th. Consistently, in polls taken inside
 Israel. In fact, one of the only things that the Middle Eastern peoples can agree on in this conflict
 is that the Israeli prime minister and his government need to go, that they are not fit for office
 either to govern Israel and defend Israel or to engage and create peace with the Palestinians.
 It's interesting to bring up the government of Israel and how people are perceiving their
 actions in the lead up to, and even just in the response of the October 7th attack. I'm curious
 to bring it to the surrounding nations and their relationship with Israel, and you mentioned how
 the treatment of Palestinians is taking a back seat to recent concerns. I'm curious if you can
 paint a broader picture of what types of relationships have been happening between Israel and other
 nations, other Arab nations that surround them, and how the concerns of the Palestinians have just
 not been the forefront of their discussions between those parties.
 No, they have not. And to be fair, I mean, the fact that the Palestinians have not been
 diplomatically important to, for example, the Gulf states or even to countries like Jordan and
 Egypt that have been more willing to engage with Israel as the Palestinian plight has become worse,
 there has been a lot of effort to bring aid, humanitarian support in for the Palestinians,
 and the Gulf states who are very wealthy have been providing a lot of that. But when the Israeli
 government after the events of October 7th started engaging in widespread bombardment across Gaza,
 which has led to thousands and thousands of casualties, civilian casualties, children,
 almost 50% of the Gaza population are children, right? I mean, this is now being seen across the
 region, and it is impossible for any government of the region, any Arab government of the region,
 to just sit and stand by and say, okay, we don't care, we're still going to work with Israel,
 the way we were working with them. Israel had benefited from being seen as an economic juggernaut,
 a security juggernaut, a technological juggernaut, and a lot of the countries in the region wanted
 to work more closely with Israel as a consequence of that. That's why you had the UAE and Bahrain
 and Morocco signing the Abraham Accords, not just to normalize diplomatic relations,
 but also to dramatically expand trade and investment with Israel. That's why the Saudis were improving
 their informal relations, and we're moving towards normalization, even though the Saudi population
 is going to be quite cautious and conservative on the Palestinian issue. They say, no, the priority
 is we've got to find a way to work with Israel. But once you have Israel in response to these
 terrorist acts going after Hamas, and as they're doing so killing all of these Palestinian civilians,
 well, then there's a freeze on everything. Then if you're, you know, Jordan, you say, we can't
 work with, we can't engage with Israel going forward. If you're Turkey, Turkish President Erdogan,
 who has said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, he has said that Hamas is a liberation
 movement, and he hasn't condemned Hamas from the hostages they've taken, from the 1400
 civilians that they killed, not at all. So they've thrown out the Israeli diplomats
 on the ground as well. And when that's happening across the region and the Arab street is demonstrating
 in solidarity with the Palestinians, then even if you have a number of wealthier Arab countries
 that want to continue to work with Israel, they can't because of the domestic pressure.
 And so the efforts that had made Israel the strongest geopolitically that it had ever been
 since independence suddenly are moving in a very different direction. It's hard for those
 countries to even maintain present levels of engagement with Israel, and indeed a lot of
 the progress that had been made could be lost. So it's very interesting. You have an environment
 where before the acts of October 7th, Israel was the most divided domestically because of the
 response to Netanyahu, but the strongest in the region. Then the events of October 7th happen,
 and suddenly Israel is enormously unified. Everyone is responding. You get a unity war cabinet
 because everyone says we must defeat Hamas. We must destroy these terrorists that have just
 threatened our homeland and have killed our children, right? But the international environment
 from Israel has suddenly become one of massive criticism and condemnation. And that is clearly
 true in its immediate region. It is clearly true for Iran, which continues along with Hamas
 to believe that the Jewish people in the state of Israel should be replaced with Palestine.
 But that's also true for all of the proxies of Iran across the region, the Shia proxies in Yemen
 and in Iraq and Syria. It's true across the global south where we have governments that are
 outraged and coming after Israel. And even for the United States, which is by far the strongest
 ally of Israel in the world, you have significant pressure, especially among young people and
 especially among Democrats in Congress, saying we can no longer provide the kind of support
 that we have historically given what's happening presently on the ground. So domestically in Israel,
 much more cohesive and stronger and resilient internationally, much more fragmented and much
 more challenging for the Israelis going forward. I'm curious to think about this situation in
 regards to what Hamas's motivation was for the attack. And so do you think that there
 was a strategic goal of the Hamas attack on October 7th? And was this in a way setting a trap for
 Israel? And if so, was it successful? Was this outcome of people turning the tide of opinion
 against Israel internationally part of a strategic goal for Hamas when doing this attack?
 It's very hard to say that Hamas actually expected the kind of success that they experienced on
 October 7th. There were some 2000 Hamas fighters, terrorists, that managed to get across one of
 the most well-defended borders with some of the best intelligence out there, human intelligence,
 signals intelligence, managed to get across the border, kill Israelis with reckless abandon
 and capture some 250 hostages and bring them back into Gaza. I have a hard time believing
 that Hamas expected that they would have that kind of success, that they would be able to kill
 more Jews in one day than it happened anywhere in the world since the Holocaust. I have a hard time
 with that. I think it turned out that Netanyahu and the Israeli government was dramatically weaker
 and less focused on defense than Hamas could have anticipated. Because the level of success
 that Hamas has had is a death sentence for those leaders and for those fighters. I mean, there is
 really no choice. There is no one in the Israeli political leadership, the entire spectrum from
 left to right that would say, ""Oh, we can now leave Hamas intact. We've hit him for a few weeks and
 that's enough."" I mean, the idea that Israel, after what they experienced on October 7th,
 would have a few weeks of attacks, but then could still live neighboring to Gaza, which is being
 run and controlled by Hamas. No country in the world would live with that. And let's also remember
 that the people that were killed by Hamas, the people that are hostages, those that are Israeli,
 by the way, these are not, this isn't a settler population, this isn't a hard right population,
 this was a progressive population. These were the people in Israel that were most interested in
 making peace with the Palestinians. And so you now have a situation where people that I know
 friends of mine in Israel that I would consider to be very thoughtful, moderate,
 politically, that are saying, ""I want to level this place. I want to make it a parking lot,
 not differentiating between Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians and Palestinian women
 and children."" I mean, to you and I, that sounds insane. But on the back of what the Israelis have
 just experienced, that is the emotion that is coming out. And so I don't think that Hamas expected
 that they were going to have that kind of success. But I absolutely believe that Hamas' efforts
 to defend themselves. And when I say themselves, I don't mean the Palestinian people. I mean,
 just the fighters and the leadership, they do that by attempting to get the Israeli defense forces
 to kill Palestinian innocents, to kill civilians. And what we have now seen for a month
 has been extraordinary brutality and violence. And we have seen refugee camps and hospitals
 and schools and United Nations aid workers blown to pieces by Israeli defense forces.
 And the Israeli defense forces are the ones that are pulling the trigger. They are the ones that
 are bombing these people. And now there's a ground war. They're the ones that are on the ground as
 well. But it is Hamas that is operating on the ground with tunnels underneath those targets.
 It is Hamas that has their missiles and their commanders in residential buildings
 and right next to playgrounds and right next to hospitals and even shooting out of mosques.
 Now, they know exactly what they're doing. They're not just holding 200 plus Israelis and other
 civilians hostage illegally, but they're also holding large numbers of Palestinian civilians
 hostage. And so the Israelis, yes, the Israeli defense forces are responsible when they are
 killing lots and lots of Palestinian civilians to get at one, two or three militants.
 But Hamas is also deeply responsible for making the only way that Israel can kill terrorists
 to ensure that large numbers of Palestinian civilians also die. That they are not just fighting
 Israel militarily because they will lose badly if they fight Israel militarily. They are fighting
 in the court of public opinion. They are fighting an information war and they are using disinformation.
 We have seen this play out over four weeks and there aren't that many Jews around the world.
 There are a lot more Muslims. And so if Hamas is able to get out all of this information
 that says look at all of these Palestinian kids that the Israelis are killing and they don't say
 anything about how Hamas is also putting them at risk, well, then they're going to look a lot
 stronger. And is that a trap for Israel? Absolutely that's a trap for Israel. Absolutely that makes
 Israel weaker and more vulnerable than the geopolitical position they were in on October 6th.
 I mean that strong position of Israel with the countries of the region working with them,
 that's a direct threat to the future of Hamas. That's a direct threat to their being able
 to drive their agenda to undermine Israel, to remove Israel from the region. And the problem
 is that you can't have this conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it because it's the headlines.
 And so you can do a minute of it. You can do two minutes of it and you move on to the next thing.
 If you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense Forces are responsible for these brutal
 killings or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th and you don't talk about
 the broader context, you are absolutely not understanding what's happening in this war right now.
 I'm interested in talking about disinformation and misinformation. You mentioned that as part of
 your answer to the previous question. I'm curious what you think the role digital media plays in
 this conflict, both being a vehicle for disinformation but also being a vehicle for accurate on the
 ground information about what's happening. It has become increasingly difficult for anyone to get
 good, valuable information on social media, on Israel, Palestine. The number of accounts
 that if you look not at one post, but if then you go back into the account and say, okay,
 what are they presenting? Are they actually presenting the news because it's being put out
 as if they're presenting the news? There's a headline that you need to focus on. Then you
 realize, wait a second, this entire account is only focusing on the suffering of Jews or this
 entire account is only focusing on the suffering of Palestinians. I would wager that that is the
 vast majority of the social media verified, algorithmically promoted accounts that people are
 presently digesting on this conflict. And by definition, that is disinformation,
 because it is not interested in understanding the entirety of what's going on. The one thing
 that we know for certain is that the level of suffering that has occurred on the ground for Jews
 and for Palestinians over the last four weeks is unlike almost anything that's been experienced
 by anyone watching this video right now. And yet you would never feel that way if you were
 digesting the accounts that are driving most of the media in social platforms. So fundamentally,
 this is a disinformation rich and dominant environment. Some of that is assertively fake news.
 Some of that is assertively filtered and promote programmed news that only gets you
 one piece, one side of the story. And God forbid, you say something that is more nuanced,
 that doesn't align fully with what either or both of those sides are promoting.
 They come after you and they say it's fake news. They come after you and they call for violence.
 They call to dox you. They'll call for they'll be death threats. And I've seen this with almost
 everyone I know that's trying to have a more civil, a more focused, decent grounded human
 conversation. This is nothing like what people are like in the real world. In the real world,
 everyone understands that they're both people. In fact, they come from the same part of the world,
 their family. But you wouldn't get that if you were on social media. Now, I want to be clear that
 when you say that something is not black or white, that doesn't mean everything is the same shade
 of gray. I mean, we can all admit that Hamas targeting civilians is not the same thing
 as Israel targeting the military, but also killing a lot of civilians. We can also both agree that
 both of those are deeply problematic compared to not having any civilians die. We know that.
 We also know that the economic conditions that Palestinians are living under in Gaza
 are radically worse than those of Palestinians in the West Bank, which are radically worse than
 those of Jews living in Israel. That's context. Those are not equal shades of gray, but it's not
 black or white. There is no space for that on social media. There's none. Social media is dehumanizing.
 It is hate inducing. And it is actively preventing people from getting good information and from
 talking to each other. What we need is less social media. We need more long form content.
 We need more person to person engagement. We need more community, more schools, more family.
 We need more humanity. Algorithms are not humanity. Algorithms are programmed by business models
 that are productizing people for profit. And it just so happens that the process of doing that
 is facilitated more directly through very, very strong emotions. That is what we have today,
 but that is the opposite from what we need if we want to understand and if we want to resolve
 this Israel Gaza war. I would love to just do a quick follow up on that because one of
 the things that I found interesting as a dynamic was certainly when there was the hospital bombing
 that happened in Gaza. And there was a rush of reports that said Israel was to blame for that
 attack. And then following up, there was a lot of what seemed like open source intelligence reporting
 that said that that might not have been the case. How do you take an example like that where a legacy
 institution like the New York Times and some other institutions reported something that ended up
 being walked back in terms of the truthfulness of the statement? How do you weigh that with what
 you were just talking about in terms of social media? Information warfare. This was the New York
 Times. It was the Wall Street Journal. So it wasn't just left or right. It was both. They both have a
 lot of journalists that are very professional and they do very solid work. But they were getting
 their real time information from social media from the region. And it was a disinformation rich
 environment. And so you see these blaring headlines. And it's the middle of the night when this
 hospital is hit and no one has good information. You don't have journalists that are on the ground
 that are that are real time reporting to you. So they're getting that information second hand
 from journalists on the ground. And most of those journalists are getting that information
 from Hamas sources. And so they said a hospital is hit. 500 people are dead. And it was an Israeli
 missile that hit them. And it turned out that all three of those pieces of information were false.
 It was a hospital parking lot was hit. Far fewer people were killed though a lot of people were
 killed. And it was not an Israeli defense forces missile that hit them. But by that point the story
 had already went out to everyone who wanted to believe that. And they ran with it. And not just
 the journalists that are more supportive of the Palestinian than the Israeli cause. But also the
 governments in the region who condemned Israel, the governments of the region who decided they
 weren't going to meet with Biden, the Palestinian Authority, the Jordanian Egyptians, as Biden was
 meeting with Netanyahu. Now this was absolutely essential at a time that the United States
 was sending its president to try to find a way to stabilize this environment. They probably
 would have failed. But they're much more likely to fail if they can only talk to Israel and they
 can't talk to the other side. And they failed because of Hamas misinformation. This was happening
 to a lesser degree in the early stages of the Russia-Ukraine war. But it was happening much
 more successfully by the Ukrainians who almost everyone in the world supported. So you'll remember
 there was this Snake Island attack. And you had this news report that was put out and promoted
 by the Ukrainian military and the government that showed that there were people on the ground.
 And the Russians demanded that they surrender. They refused. They used an obscenity. And the
 Russians blew them all up and they died. And they were seen as heroes all over the world,
 except it never happened. No one was killed on Snake Island. The people were captured
 and they were released. And that got a little bit of news weeks later. But the purpose was
 already served. Equal disinformation. Everyone ran with that story. The New York Times,
 the Wall Street Journal, they ran with that story. But it didn't have as much of an impact because
 everyone was sympathetic to Ukraine anyway. And it wasn't going to change. Whether it happened or
 didn't happen wasn't going to change the outcome. In this circumstance, early fog of war, but there
 was massive, massive disagreement over like who you wanted to sympathize with. And right? Because
 a lot of people are sympathetic to the Palestinians who historically had a much, much harder situation
 and the Israelis are more powerful. But then a lot of people are really sympathetic to Israel
 because of the terrorist attack against all of them. So there's a lot to play for. And the fact
 that Hamas had that meaningfully successful disinformation in the early moments of the war
 was a really big win for them. Either way, the point is the same, that we are no longer fighting a war
 that is only on the ground with the success or not of who's winning militarily. So much more
 of the fight is being determined by who is able to drive real time disinformation with the headlines
 in social media. Israel has launched a ground offensive in Gaza. Do you believe such actions
 will make Israel safer? Or do you believe it could have the opposite effect? My view is that Israel
 has every right to want to destroy Hamas as an organization. But we are talking about 30 to 40,000
 fighters. And Hamas is, they are absolutely integrated in the firmament of civilian society
 across Gaza. And you may remember that in the early days of the war, Israel said that they were
 going to do a siege on all of Gaza. So not just Hamas because you can't have a siege on Hamas.
 Instead, it was 2.3 million people were not getting you food. We're not getting you water.
 We're not getting you fuel. We're not getting you medication. And that is going to cause
 massive humanitarian tragedy. But that was the Israeli response. And my response to that is,
 you don't want to do that. That's going to create war crimes. And so you need to get
 humanitarian aid in. Finally, they got some in, but nowhere near enough. Then as they're bombing,
 and they're bombing all sorts of targets. And as I said, it's not just fighting against Hamas
 on the ground. It's also fighting information warfare. They hit an ambulance. Now, that ambulance
 looks like it was being used by Hamas fighters. But if you've got videos that are showing that the
 Israelis are hitting an ambulance, what is Hamas going to say? What are people going to run with?
 It's look, they're hitting ambulances. So you can't, it's not just what's happening on the ground.
 It's also how what's happening on the ground is perceived. So now you have a ground war.
 And that ground war is going to lead to far, far more Palestinian civilians getting killed.
 And it's happening before large numbers of civilians can get out. The Israeli government
 has been, they've sent leaflets. They've warned everyone, you've got to evacuate.
 But they're telling people to evacuate into the south before there's adequate food or water or
 fuel or medicine for those people in the south, before there are adequate refugee camps set up
 for those people in the south. So who's going to leave? How many people will go? And of course,
 Hamas is also preventing some of them from leaving. It's hard to do. So my point is,
 Israel has time. There is an urgent desire to get rid of Hamas. But the Israelis are now laser
 focused on their border security in a way that their government was not before October 7th.
 They are laser focused on air defense. They're laser focused on sea defense in a way that they
 were not before October 7th. So my point is spend more time, not just on how you're going to blow
 up Hamas, but also on building your information war, on building your relations with other countries.
 If you're losing support from the United States because you refuse to allow in aid
 for the Palestinians, then you need to spend more time sending in aid with the Palestinians.
 If you're losing the Europeans, Ukraine has been in a much stronger position because the entire
 West was standing with Ukraine. The entire West is not standing with Israel. And in part, that's
 because the Israeli war cabinet has refused to allow in the aid. They've refused to provide
 adequate safe zones for the Palestinians to be able to spend time to get to
 and to live as families. That's a huge problem. So I believe that ultimately the Israelis will be
 safer if they spend more time working with their allies and developing a multilateral response.
 Nobody out there from the West believes that Israel should leave Hamas alone. Nobody believes
 that there should be a permanent ceasefire and they don't have the right to defend themselves.
 That's not the argument. The argument has been for a humanitarian pause. The argument has been
 for a temporary ceasefire that allows far more Palestinians to have the ability to live
 and to live safely because the future of Israel and peace in the region depends
 not just on Israel destroying Hamas, but also depends on the ability to create conditions for
 peace between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. And yes, there are some
 in Netanyahu's government that have no interest in that. Those people will be out of government
 after the war. The Israelis do not want them anymore. Do not trust them anymore. But you can't be
 Israel will not be successful if they fight this war by themselves. They will not be successful
 if by destroying Hamas, they also destroy the conditions for long-term peace with the Palestinian
 people. We all know that when Israel was fighting against the PLO and they removed them from Lebanon,
 they ended up with Hezbollah. That's not better. When the Americans fought against Saddam Hussein
 and destroyed the bath party in Iraq, they ended up with the Islamic State. That's not better.
 So if Israel is going to destroy Hamas, but they don't create the conditions for peace with the
 Palestinian people, they will end up with something worse. So I am not suggesting that Israel should
 say, okay, okay, okay, let's we'll just make peace with Hamas. They can't that's not doable.
 No one in Israel would support that, but they have to also create conditions for peace
 with the Palestinians that will live there because they're not going anywhere. The idea among some
 in Netanyahu's government, and by the way, far too many, that what really needs to happen is you
 need the Palestinians to leave. They need to go to Egypt to the Sinai and maybe never come back.
 That they need to take more territory and let the settlers just sort of grab up all of the
 West Bank and the Palestinians can go to Jordan and they won't be Israel's problem anymore. That
 is not a viable solution. The Palestinians won't stand for it. The Egyptians won't stand for it.
 The Jordanians won't stand for it. The Gulf States won't stand for it. And these are countries that
 are not fundamentally Israel's enemies, but they will not tolerate it. So Israel must, must, must.
 At the same time they are trying to destroy Hamas, they must create conditions for peace
 for the Palestinian people. And my concern about a ground war today on the ground in Gaza is that
 they are creating the conditions to destroy Hamas without creating the conditions for peace
 after Hamas. The United States and Israel have been allies for a long time. What effect are you
 seeing from the U.S. continuing to support Israel and how could that play a role in the future of
 U.S. politics? I would say that Biden could not be more supportive of Israel following the
 October 7th attacks. His immediate decision to make a trip there, the shuttle diplomacy by secretary
 of state Blinken in particular, the willingness of the U.S. government to stay as long as the
 United States exists, that Israel will never have to stand alone. Those are enormously powerful
 statements. And they are statements that are clearly shared in a broad and bipartisan way in
 the United States. But Generation Z, young people in the U.S., support the Palestinian position more
 strongly than they support Israel. And you have seen that particularly on college campuses across
 the country, but also more broadly. And many on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,
 and I'm not just talking about the squad and Rashida Tlaib and AOC, I'm talking more broadly,
 are increasingly deeply uncomfortable with the extent of the Israeli military strikes against
 Hamas and the Palestinian civilians in Gaza, all of the human destruction that we are all
 witnessing right now. And President Biden has made it clear to the Israeli war cabinet
 that the ability of the United States to continue to provide unconstrained support for Israel
 is a window that will narrow if the present levels of atrocities continue.
 So the conditions for peace are not just about making sure the Palestinians
 have an opportunity to live. They're also about making sure the Americans can continue to support
 Israel the way they have heretofore. I think it is not guaranteed that in another four weeks time,
 the U.S. will still be willing to provide the kind of military equipment, high-tech military
 equipment and support that they have provided to Israel historically if Israel continues to fight
 the war, the way they have been fighting it. Even the United States, Biden and his cabinet and core
 members of Senate in the House are facing that pressure from their own progressive wing.
 And that is going to grow over time. I also think that this is a risk for Biden in 2024
 because this war right now is primarily about Gaza and Hamas. But there are American carrier
 strike groups in the Eastern Med and in the Gulf. They've already been involved in direct strikes
 against Iranian Shia proxies in Syria. There will surely be more of those strikes in the coming weeks.
 American servicemen and women have already taken casualties, not deaths, not so far,
 but actually injured troops because of the knock on impact of the war between Israel and Hamas.
 So if it turns out that the United States is directly involved in a Middle Eastern war,
 that Biden has not sold to the American people, he hasn't justified. You go from no wars started
 under the Trump administration to two wars started under the Biden administration. Neither of them
 started by Biden, but both of them, the American taxpayers are paying for and one of which the
 Americans might be taking casualties. That is a very hard thing to run on if you are President
 Biden and they know it. It also the distraction of the Middle East and President Zelensky of Ukraine
 has just been saying this has made it harder for people to focus on the continued support
 for Ukraine, especially given a counter offensive that has failed. So you now have these two massive
 global foreign policy crises, both of which are not looking so great for the United States
 as we head into 2024. I expect that Trump, when he becomes the Republican nominee, and that certainly
 looks very likely at this point, will make a meal out of that. That is a vulnerability for the
 United States and Biden knows it. So this is very much not just about the Middle East.
 This has implications for the U.S. more broadly and globally.
 A lot of people are viewing this as potentially a precursor to something like we would see in World
 War III. What do you think are the factors that are keeping the situation from escalating to a
 global conflict? And do you think it could potentially escalate to a bigger conflict that involves a
 lot more parties like the United States and potentially some other parties, both in the region and
 globally? We have seen that the Iranian president has and the Supreme Leader have both said things
 publicly that imply that the world will burn because of what the Israelis are doing in Gaza.
 But they use the passive voice. They are they are very careful not to say we Iran will do X, Y,
 and Z. They say these are the impacts that it will have. These are these are clearly statements
 that are meant to put Iran at a distance from direct involvement and engagement even though
 the Iranians are the ones that have provided weapons and training and money for Hamas and for
 Israel's principal enemies in the region. We've seen that from Lebanon, Nasrallah Hassan Nasrallah
 who runs Hezbollah gave a really big and very strongly anticipated speech where he said,
 you guys go Hamas, you're doing a great job. But certainly did not in any way imply that Hezbollah
 is going to be out there fighting for an opening a second front as a consequence of what
 Israel is doing on the ground in Gaza. So so far, I would say where four weeks in the likelihood of
 expansion is significant, but nobody sees World War three coming anytime soon. What we have is an
 expansion of Israel's fight against Hamas. And that means that we're going to see a lot,
 a lot, a lot more casualties. And as that happens, Israel will be under more international pressure.
 There will be more anti-Semitism. There'll be more attacks against Jews. There will be more
 Islamophobia. There'll be more attacks against Muslims. There'll be more one-off nuisance strikes
 against American bases in the region. There'll be more American strikes against proxies of Iran.
 That is an expansion of the war beyond Gaza. It is not a regional war. What we need to watch out
 for for a regional war is that number one, Iran has influence over, but not operational control
 over its proxies in the region. And as the war in Gaza gets bloodier, and if it looks like Hamas
 is really, truly losing everything that they have, there are others in the region that may
 well be willing to fight and escalate against Israel and against Americans in the region,
 irrespective of what Iran does or does not say to them. So you can easily have farther
 escalation by those organizations themselves. The Shia militants in Iraq,
 the in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen in particular, they could also engage in strikes
 into the Straits of Hormuz. They could hit oil tankers that could increase energy prices
 and create a global recession. Again, that would hurt Biden very dramatically.
 We also so far, thank God, have not seen significant lone wolf terror attacks against Americans
 inside the United States or in the region. We've already heard from the head of the FBI
 and from others that that threat assessment is higher than they've seen at any point post 9/11.
 That's a real concern. Obviously, that's something that can happen. If it does,
 the Americans are going to need to respond. So I don't think we are anywhere close
 to out of the woods on this one. And while I'm deeply concerned about people out there talking
 about World War III, because I really don't see that as a sort of proximate risk,
 the likelihood that this can escalate in ways that none of the actors want to see,
 but can happen anyway, I think that's a very real possibility.
 This question comes from a subscriber in our big think membership community.
 Is there a two state solution that ensures the rights of Palestinians as well as the security
 interests of Israel? I cannot see any environment where we have peace in the region without a two
 or three state solution, whether you have the Palestinians govern in the same way with the
 same institutions in Gaza, in the West Bank, or separate, I don't know. But clearly,
 the Palestinians must have the ability to live in peace on land that they can defend and govern.
 Now, we are nowhere close to that. But I think it was Henry Kissinger that said that the time
 you get peace is when both sides are exhausted. And he's someone that knows a lot about fighting
 wars and war crimes, frankly, but also knows a lot about negotiating peace.
 And I do think that we are oddly closer to a two state solution today than we were on October 6th.
 And the reason for that is because everyone in this region and with equities in this region
 now understand that you can no longer ignore the Palestinian issue or if you do it's at your peril.
 So yes, we're still in a time of war and it's going to get worse before it gets better.
 But as we come out of this war, the level of demand for finding a route for peace between the
 Palestinians and the Israelis will be far more prioritized. Much more capital will be expended
 on trying to make that happen. Some of that will be humanitarian resources to try to rebuild
 Gaza. Some of that will be diplomatic resources to try to come up with what a new Palestinian
 authority for Gaza might look like. Who would those people be and how would you build such an
 administration? But, you know, of course, the more suffering we see in the coming weeks and months,
 I mean, if you're already talking about half a percent of the Palestinian population in Gaza
 is dead since October 7th, one of every 200 Palestinians in Gaza dead and those numbers are
 going up. I don't know exactly what those numbers are. They fight between the United Nations and
 between like, you know, the Gaza Health Ministry, which is Hamas, you can't trust them. But the
 numbers are big. We know the numbers are big. Like every one of those civilian deaths is going to
 make it harder to get from here to there. Right. We've already suffered the pain and tragedy to
 know that we need to move to a two state solution. We know that. But the damage that you can do
 to make that much, much harder and longer term with the suffering that will be remembered for
 generations and generations, that is a very different story. Ian, thank you so much for your
 time today and for the insights you are able to provide the big think audience about this ongoing
 and complicated conflict. It's great to be back with you.
 If you found this conversation with Ian Brimmer valuable, we would love to hear from you.
 Please respond with your feedback in the comments about the format and the types of
 guests or topics you would like to see in the future. Thanks so much for watching."

 - We should try to make ourselves more comfortable
 with controversial ideas
 because it's important that those ideas be discussed.
 We can never know for sure when we're mistaken.
 There have been such a lot of beliefs
 that people have been certain of
 and persecuted people who oppose them
 that we now regard as false.
 It's quite possible that we are all agreed on things
 that we believe to be true, that are false.
 And if we prevent them being critically examined
 and scrutinized and prevent people putting arguments
 against them, we are not going to discover
 which of our beliefs are false and which of them are true.
 I founded the Journal of Controversial Ideas
 together with my co-editors, Francesca Minerva
 and Jeff McMahon, because all three of us were troubled
 by the narrowing climate of ideas that could be openly
 and freely discussed.
 When a young philosopher, Rebecca Tuval,
 published an article in which she accepted the idea
 that people who wish to be transgender
 should be able to identify as a gender different from that
 with which they were born.
 But she asked a question, if people can do that with gender,
 why can't they do that with regard to race?
 She gave us an example of somebody who had not been descended
 from African ancestry but was working for an organization
 in the United States that was helping blacks
 and herself identify as black.
 And when it was exposed that she was not really black,
 she lost her position and there was a lot of condemnation.
 And in fact, a lot of that condemnation came from people
 with the same politics as those who strongly supported
 the idea of anybody to identify as a gender different
 from that that they were assigned at birth.
 So simply for raising that question about transracialism,
 there was a petition to the journal calling for it
 to be withdrawn and criticizing the editors for publishing it.
 It was directed against a young woman
 who was an untenued philosophy professor at that time.
 So we felt that the article was one that raised a good question
 and an appropriate response for those who disagreed
 would have been to show why they thought it was wrong.
 To attack the article and say it ought to be withdrawn
 seemed to us to be completely the wrong reaction.
 And then there've been a number of other instances since then.
 It seems like university administrations have been very weak
 in standing up to defend academic freedom.
 And the idea of university administrations following
 a Twitter storm of protest against one of their professors
 having said something seemed to us to be completely wrong.
 And our concern was that people would stop publishing
 controversial ideas.
 So we thought that we're good to have a journal
 that we reviewed anonymously so people are not biased
 and then publish good articles.
 And if the authors did not want to put their name on it,
 we would accept anonymous publication.
 The argument is mostly put against the controversial articles
 that we receive are that they are going to harm
 disadvantaged or marginalised groups.
 But against that, we weigh the importance
 of having an open debate on issues.
 And the importance of an issue doesn't disappear
 if you suppress discussion about it.
 People will still think these things
 and some people will say these things.
 And because there is no open discussion,
 there won't be any good understanding
 of how best to refute the things that people have said.
 We stick by the view that John Stuart Mill put forward
 that if you want to understand a view even if it's true,
 you have to allow it to be challenged
 and you have to know how those challenges should be met.
 In the early 19th century, Jeremy Bentham,
 the founder of the utilitarian school,
 wrote essays strongly attacking the idea
 that it should be a crime for anyone
 to have sex with someone of their own sex.
 But Bentham never published those papers
 because he felt that to publish them at that time
 would have brought discredit on all of the other things
 that he and the early English utilitarians wanted to do.
 So those essays remain unpublished until this century.
 That's an example of something that people firmly believed in
 and did not allow a real debate.
 Maybe if they had been more open to controversial ideas
 and they'd had debates about that,
 then many decades of repression and discrimination
 against gays could have been avoided.
 Freedom of thought and expression is a very important,
 basic good for any society that hopes to progress,
 that hopes to improve the world's situation,
 and hopes also to progress in knowledge
 and understanding of what is true.

 President and CEO of Fire, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression,
 and he's the author of Unleashing Liberty, co-author with Jonathan Heit of Coddling of
 the American Mind, and co-author with Ricky Schlot of a new book coming out in October.
 He should definitely pre-order now called The Cancelling of the American Mind,
 which is a definitive accounting of the history, present and future of cancel culture,
 a term used and overused in public discourse, but rarely studied and
 understood with the depth and rigor that Greg and Ricky do in this book and in part in this
 conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place
 that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones,
 that should encourage bold risk-taking, not conformity.
 And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description.
 It's the best way to support this podcast. We've got Policy Genius for insurance,
 Babel for learning new languages, BetterHelp for mental health, Insight Tracker for biological
 data and the ExpressVPN for security and privacy. On the place we all love and sometimes hate
 to call the internet. Choose why isn't my friends. Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,
 we're always hiring. Go to LexFreamer.com/hiring. Also, there's other ways to contact me if you
 go to LexFreamer.com/contact. And now, onto the full ad reads. As always, no ads in the middle.
 I try to make these interesting, but if you must skip them, friends, please still check out our
 sponsors. They're awesome. They deserve all the love in the world. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you
 will too. This show is brought to you by Policy Genius, a marketplace for finding and buying
 insurance. Boy, can I tell you some stories about life and death. I've been hard at work toiling over
 videos that I recorded in Ukraine, still looking to publish soon. There's just so much. It's so
 personal. It's so rich with feeling. And one of the conversations, one of the soldiers,
 has a kind of philosophical existential discussion about life. And he describes the tension of having
 a kind of infinite value for life, because it's so visceral in a time of war, but also
 not having such a high value for life that functioning as a soldier becomes debilitating.
 So I don't know. Something about that tension that really, really stayed with me.
 About the value of life. When we look around us, how much we value life, when we look in the mirror,
 how much we value life. And that's something I constantly think about when I meditate on my
 own mortality. And when I do think about my own death and the death of people I love,
 the value of life becomes so intensely clear that life is beautiful and every single moment is
 precious. So it's funny when you think about getting insurance of any kind, and especially
 when you think about getting life insurance, those kinds of questions come to the surface
 of what is the worth of life. And also just the actual fact of death comes to the surface.
 It's a beautifully pragmatic, metaphysical, psychological, human reality of death. Anyway,

 Babbel, an app and website that gets you speaking in a new language within weeks. Boy, do I have
 some cool announcements and developments on that front for you. There's going to be a lot of
 exciting translations happening of this very podcast. Translations and overdubs and all that
 kind of stuff. I think that's the future. Forget this podcast. Just the breaking the barrier that
 language creates using artificial intelligence is going to be incredible. Podcasts translated
 and overdubbed in all kinds of languages. It's so exciting to me because I'm really
 intimately cognizant of the barriers that loss and translation barrier that's created by
 languages. And if you want to yourself break down that barrier, you need to learn the languages.
 You need to learn Spanish and Russian and Italian and German and French. I know a little bit of
 each one of those. But as they say, not enough to be dangerous. If you want to be dangerous
 in the best possible way with each of those languages, you should use Babbel,

 give zero F's about the sponsor or about civility or rules. He's like a wild stallion
 that no cowboy can ride. Now, I will let the sectional annual end of that statement just ring
 for a bit and allow you to take it in, the beauty of that. But I think he has a BetterHelp read
 that he does for like, I don't know, 10 minutes. I remember hearing it. It's just a genius friend.
 There's nothing to do with anything. And it's just hilarious. And I aspire to that
 because I think I have a little Tim Dillon in my heart. Just like I, on his podcast, told him
 that he has the bluebird in his heart. I think I have a little Tim Dillon in my heart. And sometimes
 I let him out. I let him sing a bit. And it scares the neighbors, but it's good for the soul.
 Anyway, if you're anything like Tim Dillon or me, you probably need all the therapy you can get.

 This show is also brought to you by Inside Tracker. It's a service I used to track biological data,
 data coming from my body. My body's a Wonderland. I keep saying that because it reminds me that I
 really need to talk John Mayer, one of the greatest living guitarists, blues musicians of our time.
 And also a hilarious, brilliant, and fun person to talk to. I had the great pleasure of having
 dinner with him. And it was just fun. His whole energy, his vibe, the way he moves his body,
 the way he moves his mind, the way he moves the conversation. It's just like non-sequiturs,
 interesting questions, profundity, hilarity, all mixed them together. I mean, it's a brilliant
 dude, brilliant dude. And plus just ridiculously good a guitar in every way. So the technical and
 the musical and the creative, the popular, the fun, the simple and the complicate all of it together.
 Just a genius, dude. I would love to talk to him. I would love to talk to him on the podcast,
 not just the conversation, but conversation intermixed with some guitar. I feel like there
 could be something magical created there. Why did I say that? Because my body is a Wonderland.
 And it produces a lot of biological signals and track knows biological signals in order to make
 lifestyle and diet recommendations is the future. Inside Tracker takes steps in that future. It
 gives you a shortcut to the future. Let's say it that way. You can get special savings for a
 limited time when you go to insidetracker.com/lex. This show is brought to you by an oldie but goodie.
 It's not really oldie. It's oldie for me because I've been using it forever. ExpressVPN. I'm starting
 to have more fun with these ad reads because life is short and fun is one of the best ways to
 experience this short life richly. I posted about eating or Tissery Chicken at midnight
 outside of a grocery store, which I've done hundreds of times. It's really a cheat
 code to life with Tissery Chicken. There's been times that have been $5 sometimes six at the
 super fancy California places. You can get us crazy eight or nine or $10 sometimes like $9.99
 or $9.89. We're talking about 1500 calories, sometimes 2000 calories of delicious protein with
 some fat because of the skin. It's the entirety. It's just me and the chicken and which is just
 there and we're thinking about what it all means, looking up at the stars, wondering where is this
 incredible life going to take us and also filled with melancholy and hope and gratitude for how
 amazing the journey has been so far. Something about late night with the Tissery Chicken
 is the absolute gateway to that level of gratitude. When I posted it, somebody commented saying
 eating with Tissery Chicken at midnight outside of a grocery store is how men do therapy.
 It's funny, but it's a little bit true. Anyway, speaking of happiness and gratitude, I'm deeply
 grateful for the best, my favorite, longtime VPN companion, ExpressVPN. You can check them out if
 you want to protect your privacy and security on the internet, works on any operating system,
 including Linux, the best operating system. You can go check it out for yourself at expressvpn.com/legspod

 out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Greg Lukianov.
 Let's start with a big question. What is cancel culture? Now, you've said that you don't like
 the term as it's been, quote, dragged through the mud and abused endlessly by a whole host of
 controversial figures. Nevertheless, we have the term. What is it? Cancel culture is the uptick of
 campaigns, especially successful campaigns, starting around 2014 to get people fired,
 expelled, de-platformed, et cetera, for speech that would normally be protected by the First
 Amendment. And I say would be protected because we're talking about circumstances in which
 it isn't necessarily where the First Amendment applies. But what I mean is, as an analog to,
 say, things you couldn't lose your job as a public employee for. And also, the climate of fear
 that's resulted from that phenomenon, the fact you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion.
 And it wasn't subtle that there was an uptick in this, particularly on campus around 2014.
 John Ronson wrote a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed that it came out in 2015,
 already documenting this phenomenon. I wrote a book called Freedom from Speech in 2014.
 And but it really was in 2017 when you started seeing this be directed at professors. And when
 it comes to the number of professors that we've seen, you know, be targeted and lose their jobs,
 I've been doing this for 22 years and I've seen nothing like it.
 So there's so many things I want to ask you here, but one actually just look at the
 organization of fire. Can you explain what the organization is? Because it's interconnected to
 this whole fight and the rise of cancel culture and the fight for freedom of speech since 2014
 and before. So fire was founded in 1999 by Harvey Silverglade. He is a famous civil liberties
 attorney. He's a bit on the show. He's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life
 out in San Francisco, but knew I was looking for a First Amendment job. I'd gone to law school
 specifically to do First Amendment. And he found me, which was pretty cool. His protégé Kathleen
 Sullivan was the Dean of Stanford Law School. And this remains the best compliment I ever got in my
 life is that she recommended me to Harvey. And since that's the whole reason why I went to law
 school, I was excited to be a part of this new organization. The other co-founder of Fire is
 Alan Charles Coors. He's just an absolute genius. He is the one of the leading experts in the world
 on the Enlightenment and particularly about Voltaire. And if any of your listeners do like the great
 courses, he has a lecture on Blaze Pascal and Blaze, of course, is famous for the Pascal's wager.
 And I left it just so moved and impressed and with a depth of understanding of how important this
 person was. That's interesting. You mentioned to me offline connected to this, that there is
 at least it runs in parallel, or there's a connection between the love of science and the love of the
 freedom of speech. Can you maybe elaborate where that connection is?
 Sure. I think that for those of us who have devoted our lives to freedom of speech, one thing
 that we are into whether we know it or not is epistemology, the study and philosophy of knowledge.
 Freedom of speech has lots of moral and philosophical dimensions. But from a pragmatic standpoint,
 it is necessary because we're creatures of incredibly limited knowledge. We are
 incredibly self deceiving. I always love the fact that Yuval Harari refers to the Enlightenment
 as the discovery of ignorance because that's exactly what it was. It was suddenly being like,
 wow, hold on a second. All this incredibly interesting folk wisdom we got, which, by the
 way, can be surprisingly reliable here and there. When you start testing a lot of it,
 is nonsense and it doesn't hold up. Even our ideas about the way things fall as Galileo
 established, even our intuitions, they're just wrong. A lot of the early history of freedom of
 speech, it was happening at the same time as the scientific revolution. A lot of the early
 debates about freedom of speech were tied in. Certainly Galileo, I always point out Kepler was
 probably the even more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres.
 But at the same time, largely because of the invention of the printing press,
 you also had all these political developments. I always talk about Jan Hus from a famous
 Czech hero who was burned at the stake in 1419. He was basically Luther before the printing
 press. Before Luther could get his word out, he didn't stand a chance. That was exactly what
 Jan Hus was. A century later, thanks to the printing press, everyone could know what Luther
 thought and boy, did they. But it led to, of course, this completely crazy, hyper-disrupted
 period in European history. Well, you mentioned to jump around a little bit, the First Amendment,
 first of all, what is the First Amendment and what is the connection to you between
 the First Amendment, the freedom of speech and cancel culture? Sure, so I'm a First Amendment
 lawyer, as I mentioned, and that's what I, it's my passion, that's what I studied, and I think
 American First Amendment law is incredibly interesting. In one sentence, the First Amendment is trying
 to get rid of basically all the reasons why humankind had been killing each other for its
 entire existence. That we weren't going to fight anymore over opinion, we weren't going to fight
 anymore of religion, that you have the right to approach your government for redress of grievances,
 that you have the freedom to associate, that all of these things in one sentence were like,
 nope, the government will no longer interfere with your right to have these fundamental human rights.
 And so, one thing that makes fire a little different from other organizations is, however,
 we're not just a First Amendment organization, we are a free speech organization. But at the same
 time, a lot of what I think free speech is can be well explained with reference to a lot of First
 Amendment law, partially because in American history, some of our smartest people have been
 thinking about what the parameters of freedom of speech are in relationship to the First Amendment,
 and a lot of those principles, they transfer very well just as pragmatic ideas. So the biggest
 sin in terms of censorship is called viewpoint discrimination, that essentially you allow freedom
 of speech except for that opinion. And it's found to be more defensible, and I think this makes sense
 that if you set up a forum and we're only going to talk about economics to exclude people who want
 to talk about a different topic, but it's considered rightfully a bigger deal if you set up a forum
 for economics, but we're not going to let people talk about that kind of economics or have that
 opinion on economics, most particularly. So a lot of the principles from First Amendment law actually
 make a lot of philosophical sense as good principles for what is protected and unprotected speech,
 what should get you in trouble, how you actually analyze it, which is why we actually try in our
 definition of cancel culture to work in some of the First Amendment norms just in the definition,
 so we don't have to bog down on them as well. You're saying so many interesting things,
 but if you can linger on the viewpoint discrimination, is there any gray area of discussion there,
 like what isn't, isn't economics for the example you gave? Yeah. Is there, I mean, is it a science,
 or is it an art to draw lines of what isn't, isn't allowed? Yeah, you know, if you're saying that
 something is or is not economics, well, you can say everything's economics, and therefore,
 I want to talk about poetry. There'd be some line drawing exercise in there.
 But let's say at once you decide to open up to poetry even, it's a big difference between saying,
 okay, now we're open to poetry, but you can't say Dante was bad. That's a forbidden opinion
 now, officially, in this otherwise open forum. That would immediately, at an intuitive level,
 strike people as a bigger problem than just saying that poetry isn't economics.
 Yeah, I mean, that intuitive level that you speak to, I hope that all of us have that kind of basic
 intuition when the line is crossed, it's the same thing for like pornography, right? You know,
 when you see it, I think there's the same level of intuition that should be applied across the
 board here. And it's when that intuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society, that's
 when it starts to feel like censorship. Yeah, I mean, people find a different thing. You know,
 if someone loses their job simply for their political opinion, even if that employer has
 every right in the world to fire you, I think Americans should still be like, well, it's true,
 they have every right in the world, and I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't
 fire someone for their political opinion. But think that through, like what society do we want,
 what kind of society do we want to live in? And it's been funny watching, you know, and I point
 this out, yes, I will defend businesses first amendment rights of association to be able to
 have the legal right to decide, you know, who works for them. But from a moral or philosophical
 matter, if you think through the implications of if every business in America becomes an
 expressive association in addition to being a profit maximizing organization, that would be a
 disaster for democracy, because you would end up in a situation where people would actually be
 saying to themselves, I don't think I can actually say what I really think and still believe I can
 keep my job. And that's where I was worried, I felt like we were headed, because a lot of the
 initial response to people getting canceled was very simply, you know, oh, but they have the right
 to get rid of this person. And that and that's that's the end and beginning and end of the discussion.
 And I thought that was a dodge. I thought that wasn't actually a very serious way of that if
 you care about both the First Amendment and freedom of speech of thinking it through.
 So to you just to clarify, the First Amendment is kind of a legal embodiment of the ideal
 of freedom of speech and then freedom of speech. As a applied to government, in this very specific
 applied to government, freedom of speech is the application of the principle to like everything,
 including like kind of the high level philosophical ideal of what it of the value of people being
 able to speak their mind. Yeah, it's an older, bolder, more expansive idea. And you can have
 a situation. And I talk about countries that have good free speech law, but not necessarily
 great free speech culture. And I talk about how when we sometimes make this distinction between
 free speech law and free speech culture, we're thinking in a very cloudy kind of way. And what
 I mean by that is that law is generally, particularly in a common law country, it's the reflection of
 norms, those, you know, judges are people too. And a lot of cases, common laws supposed to actually
 take our intuitive ideas of fairness and place them, you know, into the law. So if you actually
 have a culture that doesn't appreciate free sweet from a philosophical standpoint, it's not
 going to be able to protect free speech for the long haul, even in the law. Because eventually,
 that's one of the reasons why worry so much about some of these terrible cases coming out of law
 schools. Because I fear that even though sure, American First Amendment law is very strongly
 protective of First Amendment, for now, it's not going to stay that way if you have generations of
 law students graduating who actually think there's nothing there's no higher goal than shouting down
 you're an opponent. Yeah, so that's why so much of your focus, or a large fraction of your focus
 is on the higher education or education period is because education is the foundation of culture.
 Yeah, you have this history, you know, 64, you have the free speech movement on Berkeley.
 And in 65, you have repressive tolerance by Herbert Marcuse, which was a declaration of,
 by the way, we on the left, we shouldn't, we should have free speech, but we should have free speech
 for us. I mean, I went back and reread, repressive tolerance, and how clear it is, I forgot, I had
 forgotten that it really is kind of like, and these so-called conservatives and right-wingers,
 we need to repress them because they're regressive thinkers. It really doesn't come out to anything
 more sophisticated than the very old idea that our people are good, they get free speech.
 We should, they should keep it other side bad. We should not have, and we have to retrain society.
 And of course, like, it ends up being another, he was also a fan of Mao, so it's not surprising
 that he, of course, the system would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system.
 But that was a laughable position, you know, say 30, 40 years ago, the idea that essentially,
 you know, free speech for me, not for the, as the great, you know, free speech champion that
 HENTOP used to say, was something that you were supposed to be embarrassed by. But I saw this
 when I was in law school in '97, I saw this when I was interning at the ACLU in '99,
 that there was a slow motion train wreck coming, that essentially there was these bad ideas from
 campus that had been taking on more and more steam of basically no free speech for my opponent.
 We're actually becoming more and more accepted as, and partially because academia was becoming
 less and less viewpoint diverse. I think that, as my co-author, Jonathan Hight points out,
 that when you have low viewpoint diversity, people start thinking in a very kind of tribal way.
 And if you don't have the respected dissenters, you don't have the people that you can point to
 that I'm like, hey, this is a smart person. This is like, this is a smart, reasonable,
 decent person that I disagree with. So I guess not everyone thinks alike on this issue.
 You start getting much more kind of like only, you know, only bad people, only heretics,
 only blasphemers, only right-wingers, you know, can actually think in this way.
 Every time you say something, I always have a million thoughts and million questions that pop
 up. But since you mentioned there's a kind of drift as you write about in the book, and you
 mentioned now there's a drift towards the left in academia, which will also maybe draw a distinction
 here between the left and the right and the cancel culture as you present in your book.
 Sure. It's not necessarily associated with any one political viewpoint,
 but there's mechanisms on both sides that result in cancellation and censorship,
 in violation of freedom of speech. So one thing I want to be really clear about is the book takes
 on both right and left cancel culture. They're different in a lot of ways, and definitely,
 you know, cancel culture from the left is more important in academia, where the left
 dominates. But we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures.
 We talk a lot about cancel culture on campus as well, because even though most of the attempts
 that come from on campus to get people canceled are still from the left, there are a lot of attacks
 that come from the right, that come from, you know, attempts by different organizations,
 and sometimes when there are stories in Fox News, you know, like they'll go after professors.
 And about one third of the attempts to get professors punished that are successful actually
 do come from the right. And we talk about, I tend to get books banned in the book we talk about.
 And I talk about suing the Florida Legislature. Ron DeSantis had something called the Stop Woke Act,
 which we told everyone. This is laughably unconstitutional. They tried to ban, you know,
 particular topics in higher ed. And we're like, no, this is a joke. Like this will be laughed out of
 court. And they didn't listen to us, and they brought it, they passed it, and we sued, and we won.
 Now they're trying again with something that's equally as unconstitutional, and we will sue again,
 and we will and we will win. Can you elaborate on the Stop Woke Act? This is presumably trying
 to limit certain topics from being taught in school? Yeah, it basically woke topics. You know,
 it's it came out of the sort of attempt to get at critical race theory. So it's topics related to
 race, gender, etc. I don't remember exactly how they tried to cabin it to to CRT. But when you
 actually, the law is really well established that you can't tell higher education what they're
 allowed to teach without violating without violating the First Amendment. And when this got in front
 of a judge, it was exactly as he was exactly as skeptical of it as we thought it'd be. I think
 he called this dystopian. And it wasn't a close call. So if you're against that kind of teaching
 the right way to fight it is by making the case that it's not a good idea as part of the curriculum
 as opposed to banning it from the court. Yeah, it just the state doesn't have the power to simply
 say to ban, you know, what teach what professors in higher education teach. Now it gets a little
 more complicated when you talk about K through 12, because the state has a role in deciding what
 public K through 12 teaches, because they're your kids. It's taxpayer funded. And generally,
 the legislature is involved. There is democratic oversight of that process. So for K through 12,
 is there also a lean towards the left in terms of the administration that manages the curriculum?
 Yeah, there definitely is in K through 12. I mean, my kids go to public school.
 I have a five and a seven year old. And they have lovely teachers, but we have run into a lot of
 problems with education schools at fire. And a lot of the graduates of education school end up
 being the administrators who clamp down on free speech in higher education. And so I've been trying
 to think of positive ways to take on some of this, some of the problems that I see in K through 12.
 I thought that the attempt to just dictate you won't teach the following 10 books, you know,
 or 20 books or 200 books was the wrong way to do it. Now, when it comes to deciding what books are
 in the curriculum, again, that's something a legislature actually, you know, can't have some
 say in and that's pretty uncontroversial in terms of the law. But when it comes to how you fight it,
 I had something that since I'm kind of stuck with a formula, I called empowering of the American
 mind. I gave principles that were inconsistent with the sort of groupthink and heavy emphasis on
 identity politics that, you know, some of the critics are rightfully complaining about in K through
 12. And we, we, that is actually in canceling of the American mind, but I have a more detailed
 explanation of it that I'm going to be putting up on my blog, the eternally radical idea.
 Is it possible to legally, this silly question, perhaps create an extra protection for certain
 kinds of literature, 1984 or something to remain in the curriculum? I mean, it's already, it's all
 protected, I guess. Yeah, I guess, to protect against administrators from fiddling too much
 with the curriculum, like stabilizing the curriculum, I don't know what the machinery of the K through
 12 public school in K through 12, you know, state legislatures, you know, they're part of that
 they're part of that and they can say like you should teach the following books. Now, of course,
 people are always a little bit worried that if you if they were to recommend, you know,
 teach, teach the declaration of independence, you know, that it will end up being,
 well, they're going to teach the declaration of independence was just to protect slavery,
 which it wasn't. Yeah, so teaching a particular topic matters, which textbooks you choose,
 which perspective you take, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, there's like religion starts to
 creep into the whole question of like how, you know, is the Bible a lot to teach into corporate
 that into education? Don't yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm an atheist with an intense interest in religion.
 I actually read the entire Bible this year, just because I do stuff like that.
 And I never actually had read it from beginning to end. Then I read the Quran because, you know,
 and I'm going to try to do the Book of Mormon, but, you know, well, I sorry, you're so fascinating.
 Do you recommend doing that? I think you should, just to know, because it's such a touchstone,
 in the way people talk about things, it can get pretty tedious, but I even made myself read through
 all of the very specific instructions on how tall the different parts of the temple need to be,
 and how long the garbs need to be, and what shape they need to be, and what, like,
 and those go on a lot that surprisingly, surprisingly, a big chunk of Exodus.
 I thought that was more like in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. But then you get to books like Job,
 you know, wow, I mean, Job is such a read, and no way Job originally had that ending. Like Job
 is basically, it starts out of this perverse bet between God and Satan about whether or not they
 can actually make a good man renounce God, and initially they can't, it's all going very predictably.
 And then they finally really torture Job, and he turns into the best, why is God cruel,
 how could God possibly exist, how could a kind God do these things, and he beat, he turns into,
 like, the best lawyer in the entire world, and he defeats everyone, all the people who come to
 argue with him, he argues the pants off of them. And then suddenly at the end, God shows up,
 and he's like, well, you know, I am everywhere, and it's a very confusing answer. He gives an
 answer kind of like, I am there when lionesses give birth, and I am there. And by the way,
 there's this giant monster Leviathan that's very big, and it's very scary, and I have to
 manage the universe. And I'm kind of like, God, are you saying that you're very busy?
 Is that essentially your argument to Job? And you don't mention the whole kind of like,
 that I have a bet that's why it was torturing you, that doesn't come up.
 And then at the end, he decides, God decides, like, Job's like, oh no, you're totally right,
 I was totally wrong, sorry. And God says, I'm going to punish those people who tried to argue
 with you and didn't win. So he gets rid of the, I don't know exactly what he does to them, I don't
 remember. And then he gives Job all his money back and all and it makes him super prosperous.
 And I'm like, no way that was the original ending of that book, like, because this was like,
 this was clearly a beloved novel that they were like, but I can't have that ending.
 Okay, so yeah, so it's a long way of saying, I actually think it's worthwhile. Some of it was,
 you're always kind of surprised when you end up in the part, like, there are parts of it that
 will sneak up on you kind of like, Isaiah's a trip, Ecclesiastes, depression mode, and you did,
 you said you also, the Quran, yeah, which was fascinating. So what is there, it'd be interesting
 to ask, is there a tension between the study of religious texts or the following of religion and
 just believing in God and following the various aspects of religion with freedom of speech?
 In the First Amendment, we have something that we call the religion clause, and I've never liked
 calling it just that, because it's two brilliant things right next to each other. The state may not
 establish an official religion, but it cannot interfere with your right to practice your religion.
 Beautiful, two things at the same time, and I think they're both exactly right.
 And I think sometimes the right gets very excited of the free exercise clause, and the left gets
 very excited about establishment. And I like the fact that we have, we have both of them together.
 Now, how does it relate to freedom of speech? And I was right to the curriculum like we were talking
 about. I actually think it would be great if public schools could teach the Bible, like in the
 sense of like, read it as a historical document. But back when I was at the ACLU, every time I saw
 people trying this, it always turned into them actually advocating for, you know, a Catholic or
 Protestant or some Orthodox, even kind of like read on religion. So if you actually make it into
 something advocating for a particular view on religion, then it crosses into the establishment
 clause side. So Americans haven't figured out a way to actually teach it. So it's probably better
 that you, you know, learn, learn outside of a public school class.
 Do you think it's possible to teach religion from like world religions kind of force without
 disrespecting the religions? I think the answer is it depends on from whose perspective.
 Well, like the practitioner say you're like an Orthodox follower of a particular religion.
 Yeah. Is it possible to not piss you off in teaching like all the major religions of the world?
 For some people, the bottom line is you have to teach it as true.
 And with that under those conditions, then the answer is no, you can't teach it without offending
 of someone at least. Can you say these people believe it's true? Can you reform it? So you have
 to walk on eggshells, essentially. You can try really hard and you will still make some people
 angry, but serious people will be like, Oh, no, you actually tried to be fair to the beliefs here.
 And I try to be respectful as much as I can about a lot of this. I still find myself much more drawn
 to both Buddhism and Stoicism. Where do I go? Okay. One interesting thing to get back to college
 campuses is the fire keeps the college free speech rankings at rankings.thefire.org. I'm very proud
 of them. I highly recommend because forget that even just the ranking you get to learn a lot about
 the universities from this entirely different perspective than people are used to when they
 go to pick whatever university they want to go to. It just gives another perspective on the whole
 thing. And it gives quotes from people that are students there and so on, like about their
 experiences. And it gives different, maybe you could speak to the various measures here
 before we talk about who is in the top five and who is in the bottom five. What are the different
 parameters that contribute to the evaluation? So people have been asking me since day one to do
 a ranking of schools according to freedom of speech. And even though we had the best database
 in existence of campus speech codes, policies that universities have that violate First Amendment
 or First Amendment norms, we also have the best database of what we call the disinvitation database.
 But it's actually the, it's better named the deplatforming database, which is what we're going
 to call it. And these are all cases where somebody was invited as a speaker to campus and they were
 disinvited. Disinvited or deplatforming also includes shouting down. So they showed up and they
 couldn't really speak. Yeah, exactly. And so having that, what we really needed in order to have
 some serious social science to really make a serious argument about what the ranking was,
 was to be able to, one, get a better sense of how many professors were actually getting punished
 during this time. And then the biggest missing element was to be able to ask students directly
 what the environment was like on that campus for freedom of speech. Are you comfortable
 disagreeing with each other? Are you comfortable disagreeing with your professors? Do you think
 violence is acceptable in response to a speaker? Do you think shouting down is okay? Do you think
 blocking people's access to a speaker is okay? And once we were able to get all those elements
 together, we first did a test run, I think in 2019, about 50. And we've been doing it for four
 years now, always trying to make the methodology more and more precise to better reflect the actual
 environment at particular schools. And this year, the number one school was Michigan Technological
 University, which was a nice surprise. The number two school was actually Auburn University,
 which was nice to see. In the top 10, the most well-known prestigious school is actually UVA,
 which did really well this year. University of Chicago was not happy that they weren't
 number one, but University of Chicago was 13. And they had been number one or in the top three
 three years prior to that. Really? So can you explain? It's almost surprising is it because of
 like the really strong economics departments and things like this, or what, why?
 They had a case involving a student. They wouldn't recognize a chapter of Turning Point USA,
 and they made a very classic argument that we and classic in the bad way that we hear
 campuses across the country. Oh, we have a campus Republicans. So we don't need this
 additional conservative group. And we're like, no, I'm sorry, like we've seen dozens and dozens
 of not hundreds of attempts to get this one particular conservative student group,
 de-recognized or not recognized. And so we told them, like listen, like we told them at fire,
 that we consider this serious, and they wouldn't recognize the group. So that's a point down in
 our ranking, and it was enough to knock them from, they probably would have been number two in the
 rankings. But now they're 13 out of 248. They're still one of the best schools in the country.
 I have no problem saying that the school that did not do so well at a negative 10.69,
 negative 10.69, and we rounded up to zero was Harvard. And Harvard has been not very happy with
 that result. The only school to receive the abysmal ranking. Yeah. And there are a couple
 of Harvard. Oh, Harvard. And there are a couple of people who have actually been really, I think,
 making a mistake by getting very Harvard sounding by being like, I've had statisticians look at this,
 and they think your methodologies are joke. And pointing out, and this case wasn't that
 important. And that scholar wasn't that scholar, like one of the arguments against one of the
 scholars that we counted against them for punishing was that that wasn't a very famous or influential
 scholar. So your argument seems to be snobbery. Essentially, you're not understanding our methodology
 for one thing. And then you're saying that actually that scholar wasn't important enough to count.
 And by the way, Harvard, if we even if we took all of your arguments as true, even if we decided to
 get rid of those two professors, you would still be in negative numbers. You would still be
 dead last. You would still be after Georgetown and Penn. And neither of those schools are good for
 freedom of speech to say the the bottom five is the University of Pennsylvania. Like I said, Penn,
 the University of South Carolina, Georgetown University and Fordham University, all very well
 earned that they have so many bad cases at all of those schools. What's the best way to find
 yourself in the bottom five if you're a university? What's the fastest way to that negative to that
 zero? A lot of deplatforming that when we looked at the bottom five, 81% of attempts to get speakers
 deplatformed were successful at the bottom five. There were a couple schools I think Penn included
 where every single attempt, every time a student like objected, a student group objected to that
 speaker coming, they canceled this speech. And I think I think Georgetown was 100% success, right?
 I think Penn had 100% success rate. I think Harvard did stand up for a couple, but mostly
 people got deplatform there as well. So how do you push back on deplatforming? Well,
 who would do it? Is it other students? Is it faculty? Is it the administration? What's the
 dynamics of pushing back of? Basically, because I imagine some of it is culture, but imagine every
 university has a bunch of students who will protest basically every speaker. And it's a question
 of how you respond to that protest. Well, here's the dirty little secret about the big change in
 2014. And fire me in height have been very clear that the big change that we saw on campus was that
 for most of my career, students were great on freedom of speech. They were the best constituency
 for free speech, absolutely unambiguously until about 2013, 2014. And it was only in 2014 where
 we had this very, you know, kind of sad for us experience where suddenly students were the ones
 advocating for deplatforming and new speech codes, kind of in a similar way that they had been doing
 and say like the mid 80s, for example. But here's the dirty little secret. It's not just the students,
 it's students and administrators, sometimes only a handful of them though, working together to make
 create some of these problems. And this was exactly what happened at Stanford when Kyle Duncan,
 a fifth circuit judge tried to speak at my alma mater, and a fifth of the class showed up to
 shout him down. It was a real showing of what was going on that 10 minutes into the
 shout down of a fifth circuit judge, and I keep on emphasizing that because I'm a constitutional
 lawyer, fifth circuit judges are big deals. They're one level below the Supreme Court.
 You know, about a fifth of the school shows up to shout him down. After 10 minutes of shouting
 him down, an administrator, a DEI administrator gets up with a prepared speech that she's written,
 that's a seven minute long speech where she talks about free speech, maybe the juice isn't worth
 the squeeze. And we were at this law school where people could learn to challenge these norms.
 So it's clear that there was coordination, you know, amongst some of these administrators.
 And from talking to students there, they were in meetings, extensive meetings for a long time.
 They show up, do a shout down, then they take additional seven minutes to lecture the speaker
 on free speech, not being, not the juice of free speech, not being worth the squeeze.
 And then for the rest of it, it's just constant heckling after she leaves. This is clearly,
 and this, and something very similar, you know, happened a number of times at Yale,
 where it was very clearly administrators were helping along with a lot of these disruptions.
 So I think every time there is a shout down at a university, the investigation should be,
 first and foremost, did administrators help create this problem? Did they do anything to stop it?
 Because I think a lot of what's really going on here is the hyperbureaucratation of universities
 with a lot more ideological people who think of their primary job as basically like policing
 speech more or less, they're encouraging students, sorry, they're encouraging students who have
 opinions they like to do shout downs. And that's why they really need to investigate this.
 And it is at Stanford, the administrator who gave the prepared remarks about the juice
 not being worth the squeeze, she has not been invited back to Stanford. But she's one of the only
 examples I can think of when these things happen a lot, where an administrator clearly facilitated
 something that was a shout down or a deplatforming or resulted in a professor getting fired or
 resulted in a student getting expelled, where the administrators got off scott-free or probably in
 some cases even got a promotion. And so a small number of administrators, maybe even a single
 administrator could participate in the encouraging and the organization and thereby empower the whole
 process. And that's something I've seen throughout my entire career. And the only thing is kind of
 hard to catch this sort of in the act, so to speak. And that's one of the reasons why it's
 helpful for people to know about this. Because it was this amazing case. This was at University
 of Washington. And we actually featured this in a documentary made in 2015, it came on 2015-2016,
 called Can We Take a Joke? And this was when we started noticing something was changing on campus.
 We also heard that comedians were saying that they couldn't use their good humor anymore.
 This was right around the time that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock said that they didn't want to play
 on campuses because they couldn't be funny. But we featured a case of a comedian who
 wanted to do a musical called The Passion of the Musical, making fun of The Passion of the Christ,
 with the stated goal of offending everyone, every group equally. It was very much a South Park
 mission. And it's an unusual case because we actually got documentation of administrators
 buying tickets for angry students and holding an event where they trained them to jump up
 in the middle of it and shout, ""I'm offended."" They bought them tickets, they sent them to this
 thing with the goal of shouting it down. Now, unsurprisingly, when you send an angry group of
 students to shut down a play, it's not going to end that just, ""I'm offended."" And it got heated.
 There were death threats being thrown. And then the Pullman Washington police told Chris Lee,
 the guy who made the play, that they wouldn't actually protect him. Now, it's not every day you're
 going to have that kind of hard evidence that actually seeing the administrators be so brazen
 that they recorded the fact that they bought them tickets and sent them. But I think a lot of that
 stuff is going on. And I think it's a good excuse to cut down on one of the big problems in higher
 education today, which is hyperbirachronization. In your experience, is there a distinction between
 administrators and faculty in terms of perpetrators of these kinds of things? So,
 if we got rid of all, like Harvey has talked about getting rid of a large percentage of the
 administration, does that help fix the problem? Or is the faculty also small percent of the
 faculty also part of the encouraging in the organization of these kind of cancel
 loss? Yeah. And that's something that has been profoundly disappointing, is that when you look at
 the huge uptick in attempts to get professors fired that we've seen over the last 10 years,
 and actually over the last 22 years, as far back as our records go,
 first they're overwhelmingly led by administrators, attempts to get professors punished.
 And that was most, you know, I'd say that was my career up until 2013 was fighting back at
 administrative excesses. Then you start having the problem in 2014 of students trying to get
 people canceled. And that really accelerated in 2017. And the number, so one thing that makes
 it easier to document is are the petitions to get professors fired or punished. And how
 disproportionately those actually do come from students. But another big uptick has been fellow
 professors demanding that their fellow professors get punished. And that to me,
 you're really sad. It's kind of shameful. You shouldn't be proud of signing the
 petition to get your fellow professor. And what's even more shameful is that we get,
 this has almost become a cliche within fire. When someone is facing one of these cancellation
 campaigns as a professor, I would get letters from some of my friends saying,
 I am so sorry this has happened to you. And these were the same people who publicly signed the
 petition to get them fired. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Integrity. Integrity is an important thing in this
 world. And I think some of it, I'm so surprised people don't stand up more for this. Because there's
 so much hunger for it. And if you have the guts as a faculty or administrator to really stand up,
 uh, with eloquence, with rigor, with integrity, I feel like it's impossible for anyone to do
 anything. Because there's such a hunger. It's so refreshing. Yeah. Yeah. I think everybody agrees
 that freedom of speech is a good thing. Oh, I don't. I don't. Well, okay. Sorry. I don't agree.
 The majority of people, even at the universities, that there's a hunger, but it's almost like, uh,
 this kind of nervousness around it, because there's a small number of loud voices. Yeah,
 they're doing the shouting. So I mean, again, that's where great leadership comes in. And so,
 you know, presidents of universities should probably be, uh, making clear declarations of like,
 this is not, this is a place where we value the freedom of expression when it, and this was,
 oh, this all throughout my career, um, a president, a university president who puts their foot down
 early and says, nope, you know, we are not entertaining firing this professor. We are not
 expelling the student. It ends the issue often very fast, although sometimes, and this is where
 you can really tell the administrative involvement, um, students will do things like take over the
 president's office. And then that takeover will be catered by the university. People will point
 this out sometimes as being kind of like, Oh, it was clearly like, um, my, my friend Sam Abrams,
 when they tried to get, uh, tried to get him fired at, at a Sarah Lawrence college.
 Um, and, uh, that was one of the times that, that it was used as kind of like, oh, this was
 hostile to the university because they, the students took over the president's office and I'm like,
 no, they let them take over the president's office. And I don't know if that was one of the cases in
 which the, the takeover was catered, but if there was ever sort of like a sign that's kind of like,
 yes, this isn't, this is actually really quite friendly. Well, in some sense, like protesting
 and having really strong opinions, even like ridiculous, crazy, wild opinions is a good thing.
 It's just, it shouldn't lead to actual firing or deplatforming of people. Like it's good to protest.
 It's just not good to, uh, for university to support that and take action based on it.
 And this is one of, one of those like, um, tensions in, in, in first amendment that actually I think
 has a pretty easy release essentially. You have app, you absolutely have the right to, uh, devote
 your life to ending freedom of speech and ridiculing it as a concept. And, and there are people who,
 who really are can come off as very contemptible about even the philosophy of freedom of speech.
 Um, and we will defend your right to do that. We will also disagree with you. And if you try
 to get a professor fired, we'll be on the other side of that. Now, I think he had Randy Kennedy,
 who I really love him. I think he's a great guy, but he's, he criticized us for our deplatforming
 database as saying, this is saying that, that students can't protest speakers. I'm like,
 okay, that's silly. Um, we, fire as an organization, have defended the right to protest
 all the time. We are constantly defending the rights of the, the, the rights of protesters,
 not believing that the protesters have the right to say this would, like basically the,
 that would be punishing the speakers. We're not calling for punishing, um, uh, the protesters.
 But what we are saying is you can't let the protesters win if they're demanding someone be fired
 for their freedom of speech. So the line there is between protesters protesting and the university
 taking action based on the protest. Yeah, exactly. And of course, shout downs. That,
 that's just mob censorship. Um, and that's something where the university, the way the, the way you
 actually, you deal with that tension in First Amendment law is essentially kind of like the one
 positive duty that the government has. The first, the negative thing that it's not allowed to do
 is censor you. Um, but it's positive duty is that if, if I want to say awful things or for that
 matter, great things that aren't popular in a public park, um, you can't let the crowd just
 shout me down. Um, you can't allow up what's called a heckler's veto. That's so interesting,
 because I feel like that comes into play on social media. So, um, you know, there's this whole
 discussion about censorship and freedom of speech. But to me, the, um, the carrot question is almost
 more interesting. Once the freedom of speech is established is how do you incentivize high quality
 debate and disagreement? I'm thinking a lot about that. And that's one of the things we talk about
 in counseling the American mind is arguing towards truth and that cancel culture is cruel. It's
 merciless. It's anti-intellectual, but it also will never get you anywhere near truth. And you are
 going to waste so much time destroying your opponents. Um, in, in something that can actually never
 get you to truth through the process, of course, of you never actually get directly at truth. You
 just chip away at falsity. Yeah. But everybody having a megaphone on the internet with anonymity,
 it seems like it's better than censorship. But it feels like there's incentives on top of that
 you can construct to, um, yeah, to incentivize better discourse. Yeah. It's like,
 to incentivize somebody who puts a huge amount of effort to make even the most ridiculous
 arguments, but basically ones that don't include any of the things you highlight in terms of all
 the rhetorical tricks to shut down conversations, just make really good arguments for whatever.
 It doesn't matter if it's a communism for fascism, whatever the heck you want to say. But do it with
 scale, with historical context, with, uh, uh, with steel man on the other side, all those kind of
 elements. We try to make three major points in the book. One, um, is just simply cancel culture is
 real. It's a, it's a historic era, um, and it's on a historic scale. The second one is you should
 think of cancel culture as part of a, um, rhetorical as a larger, lazy rhetorical approach to what,
 what we, what we refer to as winning arguments without winning arguments. And we mean that in
 two senses without having winning arguments or while have actually having one arguments.
 And we talk about all the different, what we call rhetorical fortresses that both the left and
 the right have that prevent you from that allow you to just dismiss the person, um, or dodge the
 argument without actually ever getting to the substance of the argument. Third part is just,
 you know, how do we fix it? But the rhetorical fortress stuff is actually something I've been,
 I'm very passionate about because it, it, it interferes with our ability to get at truth and it wastes
 time and, and frankly, it also kind of, since cancel culture is part of that rhetorical tactic,
 it can also ruin lives. It would actually be really fun to talk about this particular aspect
 of the book. And I highly recommend if you're listening to this, go pre-order the book now.
 Uh, when does it come out? October 17th. Okay. The canceling of the American mind.
 Okay. So in, uh, in the book, you also have a list of cheap rhetorical tactics that both the
 left and the right use. And then you have a list of tactics that the left uses and the right uses.
 Yeah. So there's the rhetorical, the perfect rhetorical fortress that the left uses and the
 efficient rhetorical fortress that the right uses. Yeah. First one is what aboutism? Yeah.
 Maybe we can go through a few of them that capture your heart in this particular moment as we
 talk about it. And if, if you can describe examples of it or if there's aspects of it that you see
 there, especially effective. So what aboutism is defending against criticism of your side by
 bringing up the other side's alleged wrongdoing. I want to make little cards of these, uh, of all
 of these tactics and start using them on X all the time because they are so commonly deployed.
 And what aboutism? I put first for a reason. You know, it'd be an interesting idea to actually
 integrate that into Twitter slash X where people, you know, instead of clicking heart, they can click
 which of the, uh, uh, which of their rhetorical tactics this is. And then, because, you know,
 there's actually community notes. I don't know if you've seen on X that people can contribute
 notes. And it's quite fascinating. It works really, really well. But to give it a little
 more structure. Yeah. That's a really interesting method, actually. Yeah. I actually, when I was
 thinking about ways that X could be used to argue towards truth, I wouldn't want to have it so that,
 you know, everybody would be bound to that. But I think that I imagine almost being like a stream
 within X that was truth focused that that agrees to some additional rules on how they would argue.
 Man, I would love that where like there's in terms of streams that intersect and could be
 separated, the shit talking one where people just enjoy talking shit. Okay. Go for it. And then
 there's like truth. And then, um, I mean, they're like, then there's humor. Then there's like good
 vibes. Like, you know, I'm not like somebody who absolutely needs good vibes all the time,
 but sometimes it's nice to just log in and not have to see like the drama, the fighting,
 the bickering, the, the cancellations, the mom's old. This is good to just see. That's why I go
 to Reddit are awe or like, uh, what have the cute animals ones where there's cute puppies and kittens.
 And it's like, I just want to see Ryan Reynolds singing with Will Ferrell. I mean, like sometimes
 it's all you need that in my heart. Yeah. Not all the time. Just a little bit. And right back to the
 battle for truth. Okay. So what about us? What about us? Yeah, that's everywhere. Um, when you
 look at it, uh, when you look at Twitter, when you look at social media in general, um, and
 the first, like what we call the obstacle course is basically time tested, old fashioned, you know,
 argumentative dodges that everybody uses. And what about us? And it's just bringing up something,
 you know, like someone makes an argument like Biden is corrupt. And then someone says, well,
 Trump was worse, you know, like, and that's not an illegitimate, you know, argument to make back,
 but it does, it seems to happen every time someone makes an assertion, someone just points out some
 other thing that was going on and it can get increasingly attenuated from, from, from what you're
 actually trying to argue. And when you, and then you see this all the time on social media and it's
 kind of, you know, I was a big fan of John Stewart's daily show, but an awful lot of what the humor
 was and what the tactic was for arguing was this thing over here. It's like, oh, I'm making this
 argument out. This important problem. Oh, actually, you know, there, there's this other problem over
 here that I'm more concerned about. And it, you know, and on the, you know, let's pick on the right
 here. So January six, you know, watching everybody arguing about chop, you know, like the, the occupied
 part of Seattle or the occupied part of Portland and said, and basically trying to like, Oh, you're
 bringing up the riot in January six. And by the way, I live on Capitol Hill. So believe me, I was
 very aware of like how scary and bad it was. You know, like, I just, my dad grew up in Yugoslavia and
 that was a night where we all ate dinner in the basement. Because I'm like, Oh, when the shit goes
 down, eat in the basement. It was, it was, it was genuinely scary. And people would try to deflect
 from January six being serious by actually making the argument that, Oh, well, there are crazy,
 horrible things happening in all over the country. You know, riots that came from some of the social
 justice protests. And of course, the answer is you can be concerned about both of these things and
 find them both problems. But, you know, if I'm arguing about chop, you know, someone bringing up
 January six isn't super relevant to it. Or if I'm arguing about January six, someone bringing up
 the riots in 2020, isn't that helpful? We took a long dark journey from what aboutism. Yeah. And
 related to that is straw manning and steel manning. So misrepresenting the, the, the, the perspective of
 the, the opposing perspective. And this is something also, I guess, that's very prevalent. And it's
 difficult to do the reverse of that, which is steel manning, it requires empathy, requires
 eloquence, requires understanding, actually doing the research and understanding the, the,
 the alternative perspective. My wonderful employee, Angel and Dorado, has something that he calls
 star manning. And I find myself doing this a lot. It's nice to have, you know, two immigrant parents,
 because I remember being in San Francisco, you know, in the weird kind of like,
 ACLU slash Burning Man kind of cohort. And having a friend there who was an artist who would talk
 about hating Kansas. And that was his metaphor for middle America is when he meant by it. And,
 but he was kind of proud of the fact that he hated Kansas. And I'm like, you got to understand,
 I still see all of you a little bit as foreigners. And think about like, change the name of Kansas
 to Croatia, you know, change the name of Kansas to, to some, that's what it sounds like to me.
 And the star manning idea, which I, which I like is, is the idea being like, so you're saying that
 you really hate your dominant religious minority. Like, and that's when you start actually detaching
 yourself a little bit from it, how typical America is exceptional in a number of ways. But some of
 our dynamics are incredibly typical. It's one of the reasons why, like, when people start reading
 Thomas soul, for example, they start getting hooked, because one of the things he does is he does
 comparative analysis of countries problems and points out that some of these things that we think
 are just unique to the United States exist in, you know, 75% of the rest of the countries in the
 world. Francis Fukuyama's, the book that I'm reading right now, Origins of the Political Order,
 actually does this wonderful job of pointing out how we're not special in a variety of ways.
 This is actually something that's very much on my mind. And Fukuyama, of course,
 it's a, it's a, it's a great book. It's not, it's stilted a little bit in its writing,
 because his term for one of the things he's concerned about what destroys societies is
 re-patrimonialization, which is the reversion to societies in which you favor your family and friends.
 And I actually think a lot of what I'm seeing in sort of, in the United States, it makes me worried
 that we might be going through a little bit of a process of re-patrimonialization. And I think
 that's one of the reasons why people are so angry. I think having, I think the prospect that we,
 you know, we very, we very nearly seem to have an election that was going to be, you know,
 Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton. It's like, are we a dynastic country now? Is that what's
 kind of happening? But also, it's one of the reasons why people are getting so angry about the,
 about legacy admissions, about like how much, you know, certain families seem to be able to keep
 their people in the upper classes of the United States perpetually. And believe me, like, I was,
 we were poor when I was a kid, and I went, and I got to go to, I got to go to one of the
 fancies. I got to go to Stanford. And I got to see how people, they treat you differently in a way
 that's almost insulting. Like, basically, like suddenly, to a certain kind of person, I was a
 legitimate person. And I look at how much America relies on Harvard, on Yale to produce its, I'm
 going to use a very Marxist sounding term ruling class. And that's one of the reasons why you have
 to be particularly worried about what goes on at these elite colleges. And these elite colleges
 with the exception of University of Chicago and, and, and UVA do really badly regarding freedom
 of speech. And that has all sorts of problems. It doesn't bode well for the future of the
 protection of freedom of speech for the rest of the society. So can you also empathize there
 with the folks who voted for Donald Trump? Because as precisely that, as a resistance to this kind of
 momentum of the ruling class, this, this royalty that passes on the, the rule from generation to
 generation. I try really hard to empathize with, to a degree everybody and, and try to really see
 where they're coming from. And the anger on the right, I get it. I mean, like, I, I feel like the,
 the book. So copying the American mind was a book that I, that could be sort of a crowd pleaser,
 to a degree, partially because we really meant what we said in the subtitle that these are
 good intentions and bad ideas that are hurting people. And if you understand it and read the book,
 you can say it's like, okay, this isn't anybody being malicious, you know, this is people trying
 to protect their kids. They're just doing it in a way that actually can actually lead to greater
 anxiety, depression, and strangely, eventually pose a threat to freedom of speech. But in this one,
 we can't be quite me and my, oh, I haven't even mentioned my brilliant co-author, Ricky Schlot,
 a 23 year old genius. She's, she's, she's, she's, she's amazing. I started working with her when
 she was 20, who's, who's my co-author on this book. So when I'm saying we, I'm talking about me and
 Ricky. He's a libertarian, libertarian journalist and a journalist. He has brilliant mind. Yeah. And,
 but we can't actually write this in a way that's too kind because cancelers aren't kind. There's a
 cruelty and a mercilessness about it. I mean, I started getting really depressed this past year
 when I was writing it. And I didn't even want to tell my staff why I was getting so anxious and
 depressed. It's partially because I'm talking about people who will, you know, in some of the
 cases we're talking about, go to your house, target your kids. So, so that's a long way away
 of saying the, I kind of can get what sort of drives the right nuts to a degree in this. I feel
 like they're constantly feeling like they're being gaslit. Elite education is really insulting
 to the working class. Like it part of the ideology that is dominant right now kind of treats
 almost 70% of the American public. Like they're, we talked, we developed this a little bit in the
 perfect rhetorical fortress. Like they're to some way illegitimate and not worthy of
 respect or compassion. Yeah. The general elitism that radiates
 self-fueling elitism that radiates from the people that go to these institutions.
 And what's funny is that the elitism has been repackaged as a kind of
 it masquerades this kind of infinite compassion that essentially it's based in a sort of
 very, to be frank, overly simple ideology and over simply a simple explanation of the world and
 breaking people into groups and judging people on how oppressed they are on their, on the
 intersection of their various identities. And it came to that, I think initially with an
 added appeal from a compassionate core, but it gets used in a way that can be very cruel,
 very dismissive, compassionless and allows you to not take seriously most of your fellow human
 beings. It's really weird how that happened. Maybe you can explore why a thing that has
 kind of sounds good at first. Yeah. Can be can creates, can become such a cruel weapon of
 canceling and hurting people and ignoring people. I mean, this is what you described with a perfect
 rhetorical fortress. Yeah. Which is a set of questions. Maybe you can elaborate. I want the
 perfect rhetorical fortresses. Yeah. So the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been developed
 on the left to not ever get to someone's actual argument. I want to make a chart like a flow chart
 of this about like, here's the argument. And here is this perfect fortress that will deflect you
 every time from getting the argument. And I started to notice this certainly when I when I was in law
 school that there were lots of different ways you could dismiss people and perfect rhetorical
 fortress step one. And I can attest to this because I was guilty of this as well, that you can dismiss
 people if you can argue that they're conservative. They don't have to be conservative to be clear.
 You just have to say that they are. So I never read Thomas soul because he was the right winger.
 I didn't read Camille Pogglia because I was I somewhat convinced me she was a right winger.
 There were lots of authors that and when I was in law school, it among a lot of very bright people.
 It really was already an intellectual habit that if you could designate something conservative,
 then you didn't really have to think about it very much anymore or take it particularly
 seriously. That's a childish way of arguing. But nonetheless, I engaged in it. It was a
 comment tactic. I even mentioned in the book, there was a time when a gay activist friend,
 who was I think decidedly to my left, but nonetheless had that pragmatic experience of
 actually being an activist said something like, well, just because someone's conservative doesn't
 mean they're wrong. I remember feeling kind of scandalized at some level, just being like,
 well, that's kind of it's not the whole thing when we're saying is that they're just kind of bad
 people with bad ideas. You can just throw all that guys are right winger. You can just throw that.
 Don't have to think about you anymore. Yeah. And then it can, if you're popular enough,
 it can be those it can be kind of sticky. Yeah. Like, and it's weird because because it's effective,
 that's why it keeps on getting used to this. Essentially, it should have hit someone's because
 I have a great liberal pedigree, everything from working at the ACLU to doing refugee
 law in Eastern Europe. I was part of an environmental mentoring program for inner city high school
 kids in DC. I can defend myself as being on the left, but I hate doing that because there's also
 part of me that's like, okay, so what? Are you really saying that if you can magically make me
 argue or convince yourself that I'm on the right, that you don't have to listen to me anymore?
 And again, that's arguing like children. And the reason why this has become so popular is because
 even among or maybe especially among elites that it works so effectively as a perfect weapon that
 you can use on critically. If I can just prove you're on the right, I don't have to, I don't have to
 think about you. It's no wonder that suddenly you start seeing people calling the ACLU right wing
 and calling the New York Times right wing because it's been such an effective way to
 delegitimize people as thinkers. Stephen Pinker, who's on our board of advisors,
 he refers to academia as being the left pole that essentially it's a position that from
 that point of view, everything looks as if it's on the right. But once it becomes a tactic that we
 accept, and that's one of the reasons why, I'm more on the left, but I think I'm left of
 center liberal. Ricky is more conservative libertarian, and initially I was kind of like,
 should I be really be writing something with someone who's more on the right? And I'm like,
 absolutely I should be. I have to actually live up to what I believe on this stuff because it's
 ridiculous that we have this primitive idea that you can just miss someone as soon as you claim,
 rightly or wrongly, that they're on the right. Well, I feel correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel
 like you were recently called right wing fire, maybe you by association because of that debate.
 Oh, you support the LA Times. Oh, fun. Let's talk about the LA Times.
 So yes, there's an article, there's a debate. I can't wait to watch it because I don't think
 it's available yet to watch on video, you have to attend in person. I can't wait to see it.
 But fire was in part supporting and then LA Times wrote a scathing article about
 that everybody in the debate was basically right, leaning right.
 Okay, so much to unpack there. Barry Weist has this great project, the Free Press. I've
 been very impressed. It's covering stories that a lot of the media right or left isn't willing to
 cover. And we hosted a debate with her. And we wanted to make it as fun and controversial as
 possible. So fire and the Free Press hosted a debate. Did the sexual revolution fail?
 So the debate was really exciting, really fun. The side that said that sexual revolution wasn't
 a failure that Grimes and Sarah Hader were on. One, it was a nice, meaty, thoughtful night.
 And we got a, there was a review of it that was just sort of skating about the whole thing.
 And it included a line saying that fire, which claims to believe in free speech,
 but only defends viewpoints to degrees with. I can't believe I even made it into the magazine,
 because it's not just calling us, because of course, the implication, of course,
 that we're right wing, which we're not. Actually, the staff leans decidedly more to the left and
 to the right. But we also defend people all over the spectrum all the time. That's something that
 even the most minimal Google search would have solved. So like we've been given LA Times some
 heat on this because it's like, yeah, if you said, in my opinion, the right wing, we would have argued
 back, you know, saying, well, here's the following 50,000 examples of us not being. But when you
 actually make the factual claim that we only defend opinions we agree with, first of all,
 there's no way for us to agree with opinions because we actually have a politically diverse
 staff who won't even agree on which opinions are good and what opinions we have. But yeah,
 at one time when someone did something like this, and they were just being a little bit flippant
 about kind of like free speech being fine, I did a 70 tweet long thread, you know, just being like,
 hey, do you really think this is fine? I decided not to do that on this particular one. But
 the nice thing about it is it demonstrated two parts of the book. Can't say give the American
 mind if not more. One of them is dismissing someone because they're conservative. And because that
 was the implication, don't have to listen to fire because they're conservative. But the other one is
 something a termite that I invented specifically for the way people argue on Twitter, which is
 hypocrisy projection. Hi, I'm person who only cares about one side of the political fence,
 and I think everyone else is a hypocrite. And by the way, I haven't done any actual research on
 this, but I assume everyone else is a hypocrite. And you see this happen all the time. And this
 happens to fire a lot where someone was like, where is fire on this case? And we're like,
 we are literally quoted in the link you just sent, but didn't actually read. Or it's like,
 where is fire on this? It's like, here's a, here's our lawsuit about it from six months ago.
 So it's a favorite thing. And also John Stewart daily show, like the what aboutism and the kind
 of like idea that these people must be hypocrites is something that greatest comedy, but as far as
 actually a rhetorical tactic that will get you to truth, just assuming that your opponent or just
 accusing your opponent of always being a hypocrite is not a good tactic for truth. But by the way,
 it tends to always come from people who aren't actually consistent, unfree speech themselves.
 So that hands the projection, but basically not doing the research about whether the
 person is or isn't a hypocrite, and assuming others or a large fraction of others reading it
 will also not do the research. And therefore, this kind of statement becomes a kind of
 truthiness without a grounding in actual reality. Yeah, it breaks down that barrier between what
 isn't isn't true, because if the mob says something is true, it takes too much effort to correct it.
 And there are three ways I want, like, you know, I want to respond to this, which is just giving
 example after example of times where we defended people on both sides of every major issue, whether
 it's Israel, Palestine, whether it's terrorism, whether it's gay marriage, we have been abortion,
 we have defended both sides of that argument. The other part, and I call these the orphans of
 the culture war, I really want to urge the media to start caring about free speech cases that
 actually don't have a political valence that are actually just about good old-fashioned
 exercise of power against the little guy or little girl or little group on campus,
 or off campus for that matter, because these cases happen a lot of our litigation are just
 little people, because regular people being told that they can't protest, that they can't hold signs,
 and then the last part of the argument that I want people to really get is like, yeah,
 and by the way, right wingers get in trouble too, and there are attacks from the left, and you
 should take those seriously too. You should care when Republicans get in trouble. You should care
 when California has a DEI program that requires this California community colleges, has a DEI
 program, a policy that actually requires even chemistry professors to work in different DEI
 ideas from intersectionality to anti-racism into their classroom, into their syllabus, etc.
 This is a gross violation of academic freedom. It is as bad as it is to tell professors what
 they can't say like we fought and defeated in Florida. It's even worse to tell them what they
 must say. That's downright totalitarian, and we're suing against this, and what I'm saying is that
 when you're dismissing someone for just being on the other side of the political fence,
 you are also kind of claiming, making a claim that none of these cases matter as well,
 and I want people to care about censorship when it even is against people they hate.
 Persensorship, if we can't take that tangent briefly with DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion,
 what is the good and what is the harm of such programs? DEI, I know people are a DEI,
 consultants. I have a dear friend who I love very much who does DEI,
 absolutely decent people. What they want to do is create bonds of understanding friendship,
 compassion among people who are different. Unfortunately, the research on what a lot of DEI
 actually does is oftentimes the opposite of that. I think that it's partially a problem with some
 of the ideology that comes from critical race theory, which is a real thing, by the way,
 that informs a lot of DEI, that actually makes it something more likely to divide than unite.
 We talk about this in coddling in the American mind as the difference between common humanity
 identity politics and common enemy identity politics. I know some of the people that I know
 who do DEI, they really want it to be common humanity identity politics, but some of the actual
 ideological assumptions that are baked in can actually cause people to feel more alienated
 from each other. Now, when I started at Fire, my first cases involved 9/11, and it was bad.
 Professors were getting targeted, professors were losing their jobs for saying insensitive things
 about 9/11, and both from the right and the left, actually, in that case, sometimes a lot
 more from the right. It was really bad, and about five professors lost their jobs.
 That's bad. Five professors over a relatively short period of time being fired for a political
 opinion. That's something that would get written up in any previous decades. We're now evaluating
 how many professors have been targeted for cancellation between 2014 and the middle of this
 year, July of 2023. We're in well over a thousand attempts to get professors fired or punished,
 usually driven by students and administrators, often driven by professors, unfortunately as well.
 About two-thirds of those result in the professor being punished in some way,
 everything from having their article removed to suspension, etc. About one-fifth of those result
 in professors being fired. Right now, it's almost 200, it's around 190 professors being fired.
 I want to give some context here. The Red Scare is generally considered to have been
 from 1947 to 1957. It ended, by the way, in '57, when it finally became clear, thanks to the first
 amendment, that you couldn't actually fire people for the ideologies. Prior to that, a lot of universities
 thought they could. This guy is a very doctrinaire communist. They can't be just waited. I'm going
 to fire them. They thought they actually could do that. It was only '57 when the law was established.
 Right now, these are happening in an environment where freedom of speech, academic freedom,
 are clearly protected at public colleges in the United States, and we're still seeing these
 numbers. During the Red Scare, the biggest study that was done of what was going on is I think
 this came out in '55. The evaluation was that there was about 62 professors fired for being
 communist, and about 90-something professors fired for political views overall. That usually is reported
 as being about 100. 60, 90, 100, depending on how you look at it. I think the number is actually higher,
 but that's only because of hindsight. What I mean by hindsight is we can look back and we actually
 find there were more professors who were fired as time reveals. We're at 190 professors fired,
 and I still have to put up with people saying this isn't even happening. I'm like, in the
 nine and a half years of cancel culture, 190 professors fired in the 11 years of the Red Scare,
 somewhere around 100, maybe probably more. The number is going to keep going up, but unlike
 during the Red Scare, where people could clearly tell something was happening, the craziest thing
 about cancel culture is I'm still dealing with people who are saying this isn't happening at all,
 and it hasn't been subtle on campus. We know that's a wild undercount, by the way,
 because when we surveyed professors, 17% of them said that they had been threatened with
 investigation or actually investigated for what they taught said or their research.
 And one third of them said that they were told by administrators not to take on
 controversial research, so extrapolating that out, that's a huge number. And the reason why
 you're not going to hear about a lot of these cases is because there are so many different
 conformity-inducing mechanisms in the whole thing. And that's one of the reasons why the idea that
 you'd add something like requiring a DEI statement to be hired or to get into a school
 under the current environment is so completely nuts. We have had a genuine crisis of academic
 freedom over the last, particularly since 2017, on campuses. We have very low viewpoint diversity
 to begin with, and under these circumstances, administrators to start saying, ""You know what
 the problem is? We have too much heterogenous thought. We're not homogeneous enough. We
 actually need, you know, we need another political image test, which is nuts.""
 And that's what a DEI statement effectively is, because there's no way to actually fill out a DEI
 statement without someone evaluating you on your politics. It's crystal clear. We even didn't
 an experiment on this. Nate Honeycutt, he got something like almost like 3,000 professors
 to participate, evaluating different kinds of DEI statements. And one was basically like the
 standard kind of identity politics, intersectionality one. One was about viewpoint diversity. One was
 about religious diversity. And one was about socio-economic diversity. And as far as where my
 heart really is, it's that we have too little socio-economic diversity, particularly in elite
 higher ed, but also in education period. So the experiment had large participation,
 really interestingly set up, and it tried to model the way a lot of these DEI policies were
 actually implemented. And one of the ways these have been implemented, and I think in some of the
 California schools, is that administrators go through the DEI statements before anyone else looks
 at them, and then eliminates people off the top, depending on how they feel about their
 DEI statements. And the one on viewpoint diversity, I think like half of the people who reviewed it
 would eliminate it right out. And I think it was basically the same for religious diversity.
 It was slightly better, like 40% for socio-economic diversity, but that kills me. Like the idea that
 kind of like, yeah, that actually is the kind of diversity that I think we need a great deal more
 of in higher education. You can agree with, it's not hostile to the other kinds, by the way. But the
 idea that we need more people from the bottom, you know, of three quarters of American society,
 like in higher education, I think should be something we could all get around.
 But the only one that really succeeded was the one that sprouted back exactly the kind of,
 you know, ideology that they thought the rears would like, which is like, okay,
 there's no way this couldn't be a political mistest. We've proved that it's a political
 mistest, and still school after school is adding these to its application process to make schools
 still more ideologically homogenous. Why does that have a negative effect? Is it because it enforces
 a kind of group think where people are afraid, start becoming afraid to sort of think and speak
 freely, liberally, about whatever? Well, one, it selects for people who tend to be, you know,
 farther to the left in the situation where you already have people, a situation where universities
 do lean decidedly that way. But it also establishes, essentially, a set of sacred ideas that if you're
 being quizzed on whether, you know, what you've done to advance anti-racism, how you've been
 conscious of intersectionality, it's unlikely that you'd actually get in. And if you said,
 by the way, I actually think these are dubious concepts. I think they're thin. I think they're
 philosophically not very defensible. But basically, if your position was, I actually reject these
 concepts as being over simple. You're not going to get in. And I think that the person that I always
 think of that wasn't a right winger that would be like, go to hell if you made him fill one of
 these things out. It's fine, man. I feel like if you gave one of these things to Richard Feynman,
 he'd be like, he would tear it to pieces. Yeah. Then knock at the job.
 Yeah, there's some element of it that creates this
 heart to pin down fear. So you said like the firing, the thing I wanted to say is firing 100
 people or 200 people, the point is even firing one person, I've just seen it, it can create this
 quiet ripple effect of fear. Of course. That single firing of effect. Oh, absolutely.
 Has a ripple effect across tens of thousands of people, of educators, of who is hired,
 what kind of conversations are being had, what kind of textbooks are chosen,
 what kind of self-censorship and different flavors of that is happening. It's hard to measure that.
 Yeah. I mean, when you ask professors about, you know, are they intimidated under the current
 environment, the answer is yes, and particularly conservative professors, you know, already,
 you know, reporting that they're, you know, afraid for their jobs in a lot of different cases.
 You have a lot of good statistics in the book. Things like self-censorship, one provided with
 the definition of self-censorship, at least a quarter of students said they self-censored fairly
 often or very often during conversations with other students, with professors and during classroom
 discussions, 25%, 27%, 28%, respectively. A quarter of students also said that they are more likely to
 self-censored on campus now, at the time they were surveyed than they were when they first
 started college. So, sort of college is kind of instilling this idea of self-censorship and
 back to the Red Scare comparison. And this is one of the interesting things about the data as well,
 is that that same study that I was talking about, the most comprehensive study of the Red Scare,
 there was polling about whether or not professors were self-censoring due to the fear of the environment.
 And 9% of professors said that they were self-censoring their research and what they were saying.
 9% is really bad. That's almost a tenth of professors saying that their speech was chilled.
 When we did this question for professors on our latest faculty survey, when you factored together,
 if we asked them are they self-censoring in their research, are they self-censoring in class,
 are they self-censoring online, etc., it was 90% of professors. So, the idea that we're actually in
 an environment that is historic in terms of how scared people are actually of expressing
 controversial views, I think that it's the reason why we're going to actually be studying this
 in 50 years, the same way we study the Red Scare. The idea that this isn't happening
 will just be correctly viewed as insane. So, maybe we can just discuss the leading,
 the current leading of academia towards the left, which you describe in various different
 perspectives. So, one, there's a voter registration ratio chart that you have by department, which
 I think is interesting. Can you explain this chart and can you explain what it shows?
 Yeah, when I started fire in 2001, I didn't take the viewpoint diversity issue as seriously. I
 thought it was just something that right-wingers complained about. But I really started to get
 what happens when you have a community with low viewpoint diversity. And actually, a lot of the
 research that I got most interested in was done in conjunction with the Great Cassonstein,
 who writes a lot about group polarization. And the research on this is very strong,
 but essentially, when you have groups with political diversity, and you can see this
 actually in judges, for example, it tends to produce reliably more moderate outcomes,
 whereas groups that have low political diversity tend to spiral off in their own direction.
 And when you have a super majority of people from just one political perspective,
 that's a problem for the production of ideas. It creates a situation where there are
 sacred ideas. And when you look at some of the departments, I think the estimate from the
 Crimson is that Harvard has 3% conservatives. But when you look at different departments,
 there are elite departments that have literally no conservatives in them. And I think that's
 done in a healthy intellectual environment. The problem is definitely worse as you get more elite.
 We definitely see more cases of lefty professors getting canceled at less elite schools. It gets
 worse as you get down from the elite schools. That's where a lot of the one-third of attempts
 to get professors punished that are successful do come from the right. And largely from off-campus
 sources. And we spend a lot of time talking about that in the book as well. It's something
 that I do think is underappreciated. But when it comes to the low viewpoint diversity,
 it works out kind of like you'd expect to a degree. Economics is what? 4 to 1 or something like that?
 It's not as bad. But then when do you start getting into some of the humanities? There are
 departments that they're literally none. Is there a good why to why do the universities,
 university faculty administration move to the left? Yeah. I don't love, and this is an argument
 that you'll sometimes run into on the left. Just the argument that, well, people on the left are
 just smarter. And it's like, okay, it's interesting because at least the research as of 10 years ago
 was indicating that if you dig a little bit deeper into that, a lot of the people who do
 constituents on the left tend to be a little bit more libertarian. The sum that Pinker
 wrote a fair amount about. The idea that we're just smarter is not an opinion. I'm
 at least bit comfortable with. I do think that departments take on momentum when they become a
 place where you're like, wow, it'd be really unpleasant for me to work in this department
 if I'm the token conservative. And I think that takes on a life of its own. There are also
 departments where a lot of the ideologies kind of explicitly leftist. You look at education
 schools, a lot of the stuff that is actually left over from what is correctly called critical
 race theories is present. And you end up having that in a number of the departments.
 And it would be very strange to be a, in many departments, a conservative social worker professor.
 I'm sure they exist. But there's a lot of pressure to shut up if you are.
 So the process on the left of cancellation, as you started to talk about with the perfect
 rhetorical fortress, the first step is dismiss a person. If there's just, if you can put a label
 of conservative on them, you can dismiss them in that way. What other efficient or what other
 effective dismissal mechanisms are there? We have a little bit of fun with demographic numbers.
 And I run this by height. And I remember him being kind of like, don't include the actual
 percentage. I'm like, no, we need to include the actual percentages because people are really bad
 at estimating what the demographics of the US actually looks like, both the right and the left
 in different ways. So we put it in the numbers. And we talk about being dismissed for being white
 or being straight or being dismissed for being male. And you can already dismiss people for being
 conservative. And we give examples in the book of these being used to dismiss people. And oftentimes
 on topics not related to the fact that they're a male or whether or not they're minority.
 And then we got to, I think it's like layer six and we're like, surprise, guess what,
 you're down to 0.4% of the population. And none of it mattered. Because if you have the wrong
 opinion, even if you're in that 0.4% of the most intersectional person who ever lived and you have
 the wrong opinion, you're a heretic and you actually probably will be hated even more. And the most
 interesting part of the research we did for this was just asking, every prominent black
 conservative and moderate that we knew personally, have you been told that you're not really
 black for an opinion you had? Every single one of them was like, Oh yeah, no, and it's kind of
 funny because it's like oftentimes white lefties telling them that's like, Oh, do you consider yourself
 black? John McWhorter talked about having a reporter when he talked about when he showed that
 he dissented from some of what he described as kind of like woke racism in his book,
 woke ideas. The reporter actually is like, so do you consider yourself black? He's like,
 he's like, what are you crazy? Of course I do. And Coleman Hughes had one of the best quotes on it.
 He said, I'm constantly being told that the most important thing to the how legitimate my opinion
 is, is whether whether or not I'm black. But then when I have a dissenting opinion,
 I get told I'm not really black. So perfect. Like there's no way to falsify this argument.
 That one really, that investigation really struck me.
 So, and you laid this out really nice in the book that there is this process of saying,
 are you conservative? Yes, you can dismiss the person. Are you white dismiss the person? Are you
 male? You can dismiss the person. There's these categories that make it easier for you to dismiss
 a person's ideas based on that. And like you said, you end up in that tiny percentage. You
 could still dismiss. And it's not just dismiss. We talk about this from a practical standpoint,
 the way the limitations on reality. And one of them is time. And a lot of cancel culture
 as cultural norms, as this way of winning arguments without winning arguments is about running out
 the clock. Because by the time you get down to the bottom of the, actually even to get a couple
 steps into the perfect critical fortress. And whereas the time gone, you probably just give up
 trying to actually have the argument and you never get to the argument in the first place.
 And all of these things are pretty sticky on social media.
 Social media practically invented the perfect rhetorical fortress.
 So that each one of those stages has a virality to it. So it could stick and get people really excited.
 It allows you to feel outraged and superiority. Because of that, at the scale of the virality
 allows you to never get to the actual discussion at the point. But it's not just the left, it's
 the right also, so efficient rhetorical fortress. So there's something to be proud of on the right,
 it's more efficient. So you don't have to listen to liberals and anyone can be labeled a liberal
 if they have a wrong opinion. I've seen liberal and left and leftist all used in the same kind of
 way. That's leftist nonsense. You don't have to listen to experts, even conservative experts
 if they have the wrong opinion. You don't have to listen to journalists, even conservative
 journalists if they have the wrong opinion. And among the Maga Wing, there's a fourth proposition,
 there's a fourth provision. You don't need to listen to anyone who isn't pro-Trump.
 Yeah. And we call it efficient because it eliminates a lot of people you probably should
 listen to at least sometimes. We point out sometimes how cancel culture can interfere with
 faith and expertise. So we get kind of being a little suspicious of experts. But at the same time,
 if you follow that and you follow it mechanically, and I definitely, I think everybody in the US
 probably has some older uncle who exercises some of these. It is a really efficient way
 to sort of, to wall yourself off from the rest of the world and dismiss, you know, at least some
 people you really should be listening to. The way you laid it out, it made me realize that we just
 take up so much of our brain power with these things. It's literally time. We could be solving
 things. And you get like, you kind of exhaust yourself through this process of being outraged
 based on these labels and you never get to actually, there's almost not enough time for empathy for
 like looking at a person thinking, well, maybe they're right because you're so busy
 categorizing them. What's a fun and empathy? And I mean, what's so interesting about this is that
 so much societal energy seems to be spent on these nasty primal desires where essentially,
 a lot of it's like, please tell me who am I allowed to hate? Where can I legitimately be cruel? Where
 can I actually exercise some regression against somebody? And it seems to sometimes be just finding
 new justifications for that. And it's an understandable, you know, human failing that sometimes can be
 used to defend justice. But again, it will never get you anywhere near the truth.
 One interesting case that you cover about expertise is with COVID. Yeah. So how did
 cancel culture come into play on the topic of COVID? Yeah, I think that COVID was a big blow to
 people's faith and expertise and cancel culture played a big role in that. I think one of the best
 examples of this is Jennifer Sey at Levi's. She is a lovely woman. She was a vice president
 at Levi's. She talked about actually potentially could be the president of Levi's genes. And she
 was a big advocate for kids. And when they started shutting down the schools,
 she started saying, this is going to be a disaster. This is going to hurt the poor and
 disadvantaged kids the most. We have to figure out a way to open the schools back up. And that
 was such a heretical point of view. And the typical kind of cancel culture wave took over,
 as he had all sorts of petitions for her to be fired and that she needed to apologize and all
 this kind of stuff. And she was offered, I think, like a million-dollar severance,
 which she wouldn't take because she wanted to tell the world what she thought about this and
 that she wanted to continue saying that she hadn't changed her mind, that this was a disaster for
 young people. And now that's kind of the conventional wisdom. And the research is quite clear that
 this was devastating to particularly disadvantaged youth. People understand this as being, okay,
 I should probably be right. But one of the really sad aspects of cancel culture is,
 people forget why you were canceled and they just know they hate you. There's this lingering
 kind of like, well, I don't have to take them seriously anymore. But by the way, did you notice
 that happened to be right on something very important? Now, one funny thing about freedom of speech.
 Freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you didn't also have the right to say things that were wrong.
 Because if you can't engage in idea foria, if you can't actually speculate,
 you'll never actually get to something that's right in the first place. But it's especially
 galling when people who are right were censored and never actually get the credit that they deserve.
 Well, this might be a good place to ask a little bit more about the freedom of speech. And
 you said that included in the freedom of speech is to say things that are wrong.
 What is your perspective on hate speech? Hate speech is the best marketing campaign for censorship.
 And it came from academia of the 20th century. And that when I talked about the anti-free speech
 movement, that was one of their first inventions. There was a lot of talk about critical race
 theory and being against critical race theory. And fire will sue if you say that people can't
 advocate for it or teach it or research it, because you do absolutely have the right to pursue it
 academically. However, every time someone mentions CRT, they should also say the very first project
 of the people who founded CRT, Richard Delgado, Mary Metzuda, etc, was to create this new category
 of unprotected speech called hate speech and to get it banned. The person who enabled this
 draft, of course, was Herbert Marcuse in 1965, basically questioning whether or not free
 speech should be a sacred value on the left. And he was on the losing side for a really long time.
 The liberals, the way I grew up, that was basically being pro-free speech was synonymous with being
 a liberal. But that started to be etched away on campus. And the way it was was with the idea of
 hate speech that essentially, oh, but we can designate particularly bad speech as not protected. And
 who's going to enforce it, who's going to decide what hate speech actually is? Well, it's usually
 overwhelmingly can only happen in an environment of really low viewpoint diversity, because you
 have to actually agree on what the most hateful and wrong things are. And there's a bedrock principle.
 It's referred to this in a great case about flag burning in the First Amendment that I think
 all the world could benefit from. You can't ban speech just because it's offensive. It's too
 subjective. It basically is one of the reasons why these kinds of codes have been more happily
 adopted in places like Europe, where they have a sense that there's like a modal German or a modal
 Englishman. And I think this is offensive. And therefore, I can say that this is wrong.
 In a more multicultural, in a genuinely more diverse country that's never actually had an honest
 thought that there is a single kind of American, there's never been. We had the idea of Uncle Sam,
 but that was always kind of a joke. Boston always knew it wasn't Richmond,
 always knew it wasn't George, always knew it wasn't Alaska. We've always been a hodgepodge.
 And we get in a society that diverse that you can't ban things simply because they're offensive.
 And that's one of the reasons why hate speech is not an unprotected category of speech.
 And I go further. My theory on freedom of speech is slightly different than most other
 constitutional lawyers. And I think that's partially because some of the ways,
 some of these theories, although a lot of them are really good, are inadequate.
 They're not expansive enough. And I sometimes call my theory the pure informational theory of
 freedom of speech. Or sometimes when I want to be fancy, the lab and the looking glass theory.
 And it's most important, Tenet, is that if the goal is the project of human knowledge,
 which is to know the world it is, you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what
 people really think. And what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know.
 So every time you're actually saying, you can't say that, you're actually depriving yourself of
 the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timor Karan, who's on our board
 of advisors, calls preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate picture of the world,
 which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech,
 they actually tend to think that people are more prejudiced than they might be. And actually,
 these kind of restrictions, there was a book called Racial Paranoia that came out about 15
 years ago that was making the point that the imposition of some of these codes can sometimes
 make people think that the only thing holding you back from being a raging racist are these codes.
 So it must be really, really bad. It can actually make all these things worse. And one,
 which we talk about in the book, one very real practical way it makes things worse,
 is when you censor people, it doesn't change their opinion. It just encourages them to not
 share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they
 already agree with, and group polarization takes off. So we have some interesting data in the book
 about how driving people off of Twitter, for example, in 2017, and then again, I think in 2020,
 driving people to GAB led to greater radicalization among those people. It's a very predictable
 force. Censored, but it doesn't actually change people's minds, and it pushes them in directions
 that actually, by very solid research, will actually make them more radicalized.
 So yeah, I think that the attempt to ban hate speech, it doesn't really protect us from it,
 but it gives the government such a vast weapon to use against us that we will regret giving them.
 Is there a way to look at extreme cases, to test this idea out a little bit?
 So if we look on campus, what's your view about allowing, say, white supremacists on campus to
 do speeches? Okay, okay, okay. I think you should be able to study what people think, and I think
 it's important that we actually do. So I think that, you know, let's take, for example, QAnon.
 Yeah, QAnon's wrong. But where did it come from? Why did they think that? What's the motivation?
 Who taught them it? Who came up with these ideas? This is important to understand history,
 that's important to understand modern American politics. And so if you put your scholar hat on,
 and which you should be curious about kind of everyone, about where they're coming from.
 Darryl Davis, who I'm sure you're familiar with, part of his goal was just simply to get to know
 where people were coming from. And in the process, he actually de-radicalized a number of clans
 members when they actually realized that this black man who would befriended them actually was
 compassionate, was a decent person. They realized all their preconceptions were wrong. So it can
 have a de-radicalizing factor, by the way. But even when it doesn't, it's still really important
 to know what the bad people in your society think. Honestly, in some ways, for your own safety,
 it's probably more important to know what the bad people in your society actually think.
 I personally don't know what you think about that. But I personally think that freedom of speech
 in cases like that, like KKK and campus, can do more harm in the short term,
 but much more benefit in the long term. Because you can sometimes argue for this is
 going to hurt in the short term. But I mean, Harvey said this is like, consider the alternative.
 Because you just kind of made the case for this potentially would be a good thing,
 even in the short term. And it often is, I think, especially in a stable society like ours,
 whether it's a strong middle class, all these kinds of things, when people have the comforts,
 the reason through things. But to me, it's like, even if it hurts in the short term,
 even if it does create more hate in the short term, the freedom of speech has this
 really beneficial thing, which is it helps you move towards the truth, the entire society,
 towards a deeper, more accurate understanding of life on Earth, of society, of how people function,
 of ethics, of metaphysics, of everything. And that in the long term is a huge benefit. It gets
 greater than Nazis in the long term, even if it adds to the number of Nazis in the short term.
 Well, and meanwhile, just for, and the reality check part of this is people always bring up,
 what about the Klan on campus? I'm like, they're never invited. I haven't seen a case where they
 have been invited. Usually this, the Klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse,
 and that's why we shouted down Ben Shapiro. And that's why you can't have Bill Maher on campus.
 That's why, you know, and it's like, okay, you know, and it's a little bit of that what about
ism again about being like, well, that thing over there is terrible and therefore this comedian
 shouldn't come. So I do have a question maybe by way of advice. Sure. You know, interviewing folks
 and seeing this, like a podcast as a platform in deciding who to talk to or not, not something
 you have to come face to face with on occasion. My natural inclination before I started the
 podcast was that we talked to anyone, and including people, which I'm still interested in, who are,
 you know, the current members of the KKK. And to me, there's a responsibility to do that with skill.
 Yeah. And that responsibility has been weighing heavier and heavier because you realize how
 much skill it actually takes, because you have to know to understand so much, because I've come
 to understand that the devil is always going to be charismatic. The devil is not going to look
 like the devil. And so you have to realize you have to, you can't always come to the table with a
 deep compassion for another human being. You have to have, you know, like 90% compassion and another
 90% deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue.
 And that takes just a huge amount of effort. But I don't know if there's thoughts you have about
 this, how to handle speech in a way without censoring, bringing it to the surface, but in a way that
 creates more love in the world. I remember Steve Bannon got disinvited from the New Yorker festival,
 and Jim Carrey freaked out, and all sorts of other people freaked out, and he got disinvited
 from the, and I got invited to speak on some reconnaissance about this. And I was saying, like,
 listen, you don't have people to your conference because you agree with them. We have to get out
 of this idea that that's because they were trying to make it sound like that's an endorsement of
 Steve Bannon. Like, that's nonsense. Like, if you actually look at the opinions of all the people
 who are there, you can't possibly endorse all the opinions that all these other people who are
 going to be there actually have. And then the process of making that argument, I got, and also,
 of course, the very classic, it's very valuable to know what someone Steve Bannon thinks. You should
 be curious about that. And I remember someone arguing back saying, well, what would you want
 someone to interview a jihadi? And I'm like, because at the moment, it was at the time when
 ISIS was really going for it. And I was like, would you not want to go to a talk where someone
 was trying to figure out what makes some of these people tick? Because that changes your framing,
 that essentially it's like, no, it's curiosity. It is the cure for a lot of this stuff. And we
 need a great deal more curiosity and a lot less unwarranted certainty.
 And there's a question of like, how do you conduct such conversations? And I feel deeply
 underqualified. Who do you think are especially good at that?
 I feel like documentary filmmakers usually do a much better job. And the best job is usually done
 by biographers. So the more time you give to a particular conversation, like really deep thought
 and historical context and studying the people, how they think, looking at all different perspectives,
 looking at the psychology of the person, upbringing their parents, their grandparents,
 all of this, the more time you spend with that, the better the quality of the conversation is.
 Because you get to understand the, you get to really empathize with the person, with the people
 he or she represents. And you get to see the common humanity, all of this. And interviewers
 are often don't do that work. Yeah. So like the best stuff I've seen is interviews that are
 part of a documentary. Yeah. But even now documentaries are like, there's a huge incentive to do as
 quickly as possible. Yeah. There's not an incentive to really spend time with the person.
 There's a great new documentary about Floyd Abrams that I really recommend.
 We did a documentary about Ira Glasser called Mighty Ira, which was my video team and my
 protege, Nico Preno and Chris Mulvey and Aaron Reese put it together. And it just follows the
 life and times of Ira Glasser, the former head of the ACLU. If you could just linger on that,
 that's a fascinating story. Oh, yeah. Who's Ira? Who's Ira? Amazing. Ira, he wasn't a lawyer.
 He started working at the NYCLU, the New York Civil Liberties Union. Back in I think the '60s,
 he was, I think Robert Kennedy recommended that he go in that direction.
 And he became the president of the ACLU right at the time that they were suffering from defending
 the Nazis at Skokie. And Nico and Aaron and Chris put together this. And they'd never done a
 documentary before. And it came out so, so well. And it tells the story of the Nazis in Skokie,
 it tells the story of the case around it, tells the story of the ACLU at the time and what a great
 leader Ira Glasser was. And one of the things that's so great is when you get to see the Nazis at
 Skokie, they come off the idiots that you would expect them to. There's a moment when the rally
 is not going very well and the leader gets flustered. And it almost seems like he's going to shout
 out, you're making this Nazi rally into a mockery. And so it showed how actually allowing the Nazis
 to speak at Skokie kind of took the wind out of their shells. Like if they had the whole movement,
 everybody just kind of, it all kind of dissolved after that because they looked like
 racist fools that they were. Even Blues Brothers made jokes about them. And it didn't turn into
 the disaster that people thought it was going to be just by letting them speak. And Ira Glasser,
 okay, so he has this wonderful story about how Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers,
 and how there was a moment when it was seeing someone, an African American, as on their,
 literally on their team, and how that really got him excited about the cause of racial equality,
 and that became a big part of what his life was. And I just think of that such a great metaphor
 is expanding your circle and seeing more people as being quite literally on your team is the
 solution to so many of these problems. And I worry that one of the things that is absolutely
 just a fact of life in America is like, we do see each other more as enemy camps as opposed to
 people on the same team. And that was actually something in the early days. Like me and Will
 Creeley, the legal director of fire, wrote about the forthcoming free speech challenges of everyone
 being on Facebook. And one thing that I was hoping was that as more people were exposing more of
 their lives, we'd realize a lot of these things we knew intellectually, like kids go to the bar and
 get drunk and do stupid things, that when we started seeing the evidence of them doing stupid
 things, that we might be shocked at first, but then eventually get more sophisticated and be like,
 well, come on, people are like that. That never actually really seemed to happen. I think that
 there are plenty of things we know about human nature, and we know about dumb things people say,
 and we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there waiting to be kind of like,
 oh, remember that dumb thing he said, we were 14? Well, I'm going to make sure that you don't
 get into your dream school because of that. This offense, archaeology. That's not my term,
 though. It's a great term. We steal from the best. Digging through someone's past comments to find
 a speech that hasn't aged well. And that one's tactical. That one isn't just someone not being
 empathetic. They're like, I'm going to punish you for this. And that's one of the reasons why I got
 depressed writing this book, because there's already people who don't love me because of
 coddling the American mind, usually based on a misunderstanding of what we actually said in
 coddling the American mind, but nonetheless. But on this one, I'm calling out people
 for being very cruel in a lot of cases. But one thing that was really scary about
 studying a lot of these cases is that once you have that target on your back, what they're going
 to try to cancel you for could be anything. They might go back into your old, your old
 post, find something that you said in 1995. Do something where essentially it looks like it's
 entire other thing. But really what they're what's going on is they didn't like your opinion. They
 didn't like your point of view on something. And they're going to find a find a way that from now
 on, anytime your name comes up, it's like, Oh, remember this, this thing I didn't like about them.
 And it's again, it's cruel. It doesn't get you anywhere closer to the truth. And but it is a
 little scary that stick your neck out. Okay, in terms of solutions, I got to ask you a few things.
 So one parenting, yeah, five and seven year old. So I'm sure you've figured it all out then.
 Oh, God, no, from a free speech perspective. Yeah, from a free speech culture perspective,
 how to be a good parent. Yeah, I think the first quality you should be cultivating in your children,
 if you want to have a free speech culture, is curiosity, and an awareness of the vastness
 that will always be unknown. And getting my kids excited about the idea that's like,
 we're going to spend our whole lives learning about stuff. And it's fast and exciting and endless,
 and we'll never make a big dent in it. But the journey will be amazing. But only fools think
 they know everything. And sometimes dangerous fools at that. So giving the sense of intellectual
 humility early on being also, you know, saying things that actually do sound kind of old-fashioned,
 like, but I say things to my kids like, listen, if you enjoy study and work,
 both things that I very much enjoy, I do for fun, your life is going to feel great, and it's going
 to feel easy. So some of those old fashioned virtues are things I try to preach. Counterintuitive
 stuff like outdoor time, playing, having time that are not intermediated experiences is really
 is really important. And little things, like I talk about on the book about when my kids
 are watching something that's scary. And I'm not talking about like zombie movies, you know,
 I'm talking about like a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment, and saying that they want to turn
 the TV off. And I talk to them, and I say, listen, I'm going to sit next to you, and we're going to
 finish this show. And I want you to tell me what you think of this afterwards. And I sat next to
 my sons. And by the end of it, every single time, you know, when I asked them, was that as scary as
 you thought it was going to be? And there was like, no, daddy, that was fine. And I'm like,
 that's one of the great lessons in life. The fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in
 your head than actually simply facing it. That's one of the reasons why I'm fighting back against
 this culture. I love, you know, for all of our kids to be able to grow up in an environment where
 people give you grace. And, you know, the accept the fact that sometimes people are going to say
 things that piss you off, take seriously the possibility to be wrong and be curious.
 Well, I have hoped that the thing you mentioned, which is because so much of young people's stuff
 is on the internet, that they're going to give each other a break, because then everybody is
 kind of worthy. Generation Z hates cancel culture the most. And that's another reason why it's like
 people still claiming this is even happening is kind of like, no, you actually can ask, you know,
 kids what they think of cancel culture. And they hate it. Yeah. Well, I kind of think of them as
 like the immune system. That's like, that's the culture waking up to like, no, this is not a good
 thing. I am glad though. I mean, I am one of those kids who, you know, is really glad that I was a
 little kid in the eighties and a teenager in the nineties, because having everything potentially
 online, it's not a not bringing an envy. Well, I, because you can also do the absolute free speech.
 I like leaning into it. Yeah. Where I hope for future where a lot of our insecurities, flaws,
 everything is out there. Yeah. And to be honest with it, I think that leads to a better world,
 because the flaws are beautiful. I mean, that's the flaws is the basic ingredients of human
 connection. Robert Wright, he wrote a book on on on Buddhism. And I talked about trying to use
 social media from a from a Buddhist perspective. And like, as if you're as if it's the collective
 unconscious meditating and seeing those little like angry bits that are trying to cancel your
 get you to shut up and just kind of like letting them go the same way you're supposed to watch
 your thoughts kind of trail off. I would love to see that like visualized, whatever the,
 whatever the drama going on, going on, just seeing the sea of it, of the collective consciousness,
 just processing this and having a little like panic attack and just kind of like,
 yeah, reading it in looking at the little sort of hateful angry voices kind of pop up and be like,
 okay, there you are. And I'm still focused on that thing, because that is that that is one of
 the things is, okay, yeah, actually, this is probably late in the game to be to giving my
 grand theory on this stuff. But never too late. So, so what I was studying in law school when I
 ran out of First Amendment classes, I decided to study censorship during the Tudor dynasty,
 because that's where we get our ideas of prior restraint that come from the licensing of the
 printing press, which was something that Henry VIII was the first to do, where basically,
 the idea was that if you can't print anything in England unless it's with these, your majesty
 approved printers, it will prevent heretical work and anti Henry VIII stuff from coming out.
 Yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty efficient idea of nothing else. And I always, so he started
 getting angry at the printing press around 1521, and then passed something that required prints
 to be along with Parliament in 1538. And I always think of that as kind of like where we are now,
 because we have this, we had the back then we had the original disruptive technology, you know,
 writing was probably, but the next one, which was the printing press, which was absolutely
 calamitous. And I mean, and I say calamitous on purpose, because in the short term, the witch hunts
 went up like crazy, because the printing press allowed you to get that manual and how to find
 witches, that the religious wars went crazy. It led to all sorts of distress, misinformation,
 nastiness. And Henry VIII was trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You know, he was kind of
 like, I can, I can, I can, I want to use this for good, like, like I feel like it could be used.
 But he was in an unavoidable period of epistemic anarchy. There's nothing you can do to make the
 period after the printing press come came out to be a non disruptive, non crazy period other than
 like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print presses, which simply was not possible in
 Europe. So I feel like that's kind of like where we are now. That disruption came from adding,
 I think, several million people to the European conversation and that eventually the global
 conversation. But eventually it became the best tool for dis confirmation, for getting rid of
 falsity, for spotting bad ideas. And it's the benefits, the long term benefits of the printing
 press are incalculably great. And that's what gives me some optimism for where we are now with
 social media, because we are in that unavoidably anarchical period. And I do worry that there,
 that there are attempts and states to pass things to try to put the genie back in the bottle. Like,
 if we ban tiktok or we say that nobody under 18 can be on the on the internet unless they have
 parental permission, we're going at something that no amount of sort of top down is going to be able
 to fix it. We have to culturally adapt to the fact of it in ways that make us wiser that actually
 and allow it potentially to be that wonderful engine for dis confirmation that we're nowhere
 near yet, by the way. But think about it, additional millions of eyes on problems. Thanks to the
 printing press helped create the scientific revolution, the enlightenment, the discovery of
 ignorance. We now have added billions of eyes and voices to solving problems. And we're just,
 we're using them for cat videos and canceling. But those are just the early days of the printing
 press. Exactly. All starts with the cats and the canceling. Is there something about X, about
 Twitter, which is perhaps the most energetic source of cats and canceling? It seems like the
 collective unconscious of the species. I mean, like, it's one of the things where the tendency to
 want to see patterns in history sometimes can limit the actual batshit crazy experience of what
 history actually is. Because yes, we have these nice comforting ideas that it's going to be like
 last time. We don't know. It hasn't happened yet. And I think how unusual Twitter is because I think
 of it as like the, because people talk about, you know, writing and mass communications and
 as being expanding the size of our collective brain. But now we're kind of looking at our
 collective brain in real time. And it's filled just like our own brains with all sorts of like
 little crazy things that pop up and appear like virtual particles kind of all over the place of
 people, you know, reacting in real time to things. There's never been anything even vaguely like it.
 And it can be at its worst awful to see. At its best, sometimes seeing people like just getting
 euphoric over something going on and cracking absolutely brilliant immediate jokes, you know,
 at the same time, it can be, it can't even be a joyful experience. I feel like,
 and I live in a neighborhood now on X where I mostly deal with people that I think are actually
 thoughtful even if I disagree with them. And it's not such a bad experience. I occasionally run
 of those other sort of what I call neighborhoods on X where it's just all canceling all nastiness.
 And it's always kind of an unpleasant visit to those places. I'm not saying the whole thing needs
 to be like my experience. But I do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is
 it reveals raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer to pretend don't exist.
 Yeah, but also it's totally new, like you said. It's just the virality, the speed, the news travels,
 the opinions travel, that the battle over ideas travels. The battle over information too.
 Yeah, of what is true and not lies travel, the old Mark Twain thing pretty fast on the thing.
 Yeah. And it changes your understanding of how to interpret information.
 It can also stress you out to no end. Remember to get off it sometimes. The stats are pretty bad
 on mental health with young people. And I'm definitely in the camp of people who think that
 social media is part of that. I understand the debate, but I'm pretty persuaded that one of the
 things that hasn't been great for mental health of people is just constantly being exposed.
 Yeah, absolutely. I think it's possible to create social media that makes a huge amount of money,
 makes people happy. To me, it's possible to align the incentives in terms of making teenagers,
 making every stage of life, giving you long-term fulfillment and happiness with your
 physical existence outside of the social media and on social media, helping you grow as a human
 being. Helping challenge you just in the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos,
 whatever gives this full rich human experience. I think it's just a machine learning problem.
 It's like it's not easy to create a feed. So the easiest feed you could do is maximize engagement.
 But it's just like a really dumb algorithm. It's like for the algorithm to learn enough about you,
 to understand what will make you truly happy as a human being, to grow long-term.
 That's just a very difficult problem to solve.
 You ever watch Fleabag? It's absolutely brilliant British show. And it sets you up. One of the
 reasons why people love it so much is it sets you up that you're watching a raunchy British
 sex in the city, except the main character is the most promiscuous one. It's like, okay,
 and you roll your eyes a little bit. It's kind of funny and it's kind of cute and kind of spicy.
 And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time.
 And it gets deeper and deeper as the show goes on. And she will do these incredible speeches
 about tell me what to do. I know there's experts out there. I know there's knowledge out there.
 I know there's an optimal way to live my life. So why can't someone just tell me what to do?
 And it's this wonderfully accurate, I think, aspect of human desire that what if something
 could actually tell me the optimal way to go? Because I think there is a desire to give up some
 amount of your own freedom and discretion in order to be told to do the optimally right thing.
 But that path scares me to death.
 Well, see the way you phrased it, that scares me too. So there's several things. One, you could
 be constantly distracted in a TikTok way by things that keep you engaged. So removing that
 and giving you a bunch of options constantly and learning from long-term what results in
 your actual long-term happiness. So like, which amounts of challenging ideas are good for you?
 For somebody like me. But there is a number like that for you, Greg. For me,
 that number is pretty high. I love debate. I love the feeling of realizing, ""Holy shit,
 I've been wrong."" But I would love for the algorithm to know that about me and to help me,
 but always giving me options if I wanted to send into cat videos and so on.
 Well, the educational aspect. Yes, education. The idea of both going the speed that you need
 to and running as fast as you can. I mean, there's the whole flow thing. I just feel that YouTube
 recommendation for better or worse, if used correctly, it feels like it does a pretty good job.
 Whenever I just refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine-based and click on only educational
 things, the recommendation it provides a really damn good. So I feel like it's a solvable problem,
 at least in the space of education, of challenging yourself, but also expanding your realm of knowledge
 and all this kind of stuff. And I'm definitely more than they were in an inescapably in article
 period and require big cultural adjustments. And there's no way that this isn't going to be
 difficult transition. Is there any specific little or big things that you would like to see X do?
 Twitter, too. I have lots of thoughts on that. With the printing press, an extra millions of
 eyes on any problem can tear down any institution, any person or any idea. And that's good in some
 ways because a lot of medieval institutions needed to be torn down and some people did too, and a
 lot of ideas need to be torn down. Same thing is true now. An extra billions of eyes on every
 problem can tear down any person, an idea, or institution. And some, again, some of those things
 needed to be torn down, but it can't build yet. We are not at the stage that can build yet,
 but it has shown us how thin our knowledge was. It's one of the reasons why we're also aware of
 the replication crisis. It's one of the reasons why we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our
 research is, how much our expert class is arrogant in many cases. But people don't want to live in a
 world where they don't have people that they respect and they can look at. And I think what's
 happening, possibly now, but what will continue to happen is people are going to establish themselves
 as being high integrity, that they will always be honest. I think you are establishing yourself
 as someone who is high integrity, where they can trust that person. A fire wants to be the
 institution that people can come to us like, if it's free speech, we will defend it, period.
 And I think that people need to have authorities that they can actually trust. And I think that if
 you actually had a stream that maybe people can watch in action, but not flood with stupid
 cancel culture stuff or dumb cat means, where it is actually a serious discussion,
 bounded around rules, no perfect rhetorical fortress, no efficient rhetorical fortress,
 none of the BS ways we debate. I think you could start to actually create something
 that could actually be a major improvement in the speed with which we come up with new
 better ideas and establish and separate truth from falsity.
 Yeah, if it's done well, it can inspire a large number of people to become higher and higher
 integrity. It can create integrity as a value to strive for. And there's been projects throughout
 the internet that have done an incredible job of that, but have been also very flawed.
 Like Wikipedia is an example of a big leap forward in doing that.
 It's pretty damn impressive. What's your overall take? I mean, I'm mostly impressed.
 So there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit Wikipedia. One of which is
 each editor kind of for themselves declares, you know, I'm into politics and I really
 kind of left leaning guy. So I really shouldn't be editing political articles because I have bias.
 Oh, that's great.
 They declare their biases and they're often do a good job of actually declaring the biases.
 But they're still like, they'll find a way to justify themselves. Like something will piss them
 off and they want to correct it because they love correcting untruth into truth.
 But the perspective of what is true or not is affected by their bias.
 Truth is hard to know.
 And it is true that there is a left leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia.
 So for that, what happens is on articles, which I mostly appreciate that don't have a political
 aspect to them, you know, scientific articles or technical articles, they can be really strong.
 Even history just describing the facts of history. They don't have a subjective element strong.
 Also, just using my own brain, I can kind of filter out if it's, you know, if it's something
 about January 6 or something like this, I know I'm going to be like, I'm not, whatever's going on
 here, I'm going to kind of read it. But most I'm going to look to other source.
 I'm going to look to a bunch of different perspectives on it. It's going to be very tense.
 There's probably going to be some kind of bias. Maybe some wording will be such,
 which is where Wikipedia does its thing. The way they word stuff will be biased,
 the choice of words, but the Wikipedia editors themselves are so, so reflective. They literally
 have articles describing these very effects of how you can use words to inject bias in all the
 ways that you talk about it. That's faster, healthier than most environments.
 It's incredibly healthy, but I think you could do better. One of the big flaws that
 Wikipedia to me that community notes on X does better is the accessibility of becoming an editor
 is it's difficult to become an editor, and it's not as visible the process of editing.
 So I would love, like you said, a stream. Everyone to be able to observe this debate
 between people with integrity of when they discuss things like January 6 or very controversial
 topics to see how the process of the debate goes, as opposed to being hidden in the shadows,
 which it currently is in Wikipedia. You can access it. It's just hard to access,
 but I've also seen how they will use certain articles on certain people,
 like articles about people I've learned to trust less and less, because they'll literally
 will use those to make personal attacks. This is something you write about. They'll use
 descriptions of different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't to me at
 least feel like an accurate representation of the person. It's like writing an article about
 Einstein mentioning something about theory of relativity and saying that he was a womanizer
 and abuser and a controversy. Yeah, he is. Feynman was not exactly the perfect human in terms of
 women, but there's other aspects to this human, and to capture that human properly,
 there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean. They really try to be self-reflective
 and try to stop this, but they will lean into the drama if it matches the bias. But again,
 much better than the world, I believe, is much better because Wikipedia exists. But now that we're
 in these adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies,
 the idea of a stream is really, really interesting. To get more and more people into this
 course, where the value is, let's try to get the truth. Yeah, and you get little cards for,
 nope, wrong, nope, wrong. And the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to
 avoid actually discussing this. Yeah, and I think actually it can make it a little bit fun by
 you get a limited number of them. It's kind of like you get three what about it as some cards.
 It's a game of finding the whole thing, absolutely. Let me ask you about, as you mentioned,
 going to some difficult moments in your life, what has been your experience with depression,
 what has been your experience getting out of it, overcoming it? Yeah, I mean, the whole thing,
 the whole journey with Cuddling the American Mind began with me
 in the Belmont psychiatric facility in Philadelphia back in 2007. I had called 911 in a moment of
 clarity because I'd gone to the hardware store to make sure that when I killed myself, that I
 had stuck. I wanted to make sure that I had my head wrapped in everything. So like if all the
 drugs I was planning to take didn't work, that I wouldn't be able to claw my way out.
 It'd been a really rough year. And I always had issues with depression, but they were getting worse.
 And frankly, one of the reasons why this cancel culture stuff is so important to me is that
 the thing that I didn't emphasize as much in Cuddling the American Mind, which by the way,
 that description that I gave of trying to kill myself was the first time I'd ever written it down,
 nobody in my family was aware of how of it being like that. My wife had never seen it,
 and basically the only way I was able to write that was by doing, you know how you can kind of
 trick yourself. And I was like, I'm going to convince myself that this is just between me
 and my computer and nobody will see it. It's probably now the most public thing I've ever written.
 But what I didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture war played into how depressed I got,
 because I was originally the legal director of fire, then I became president of fire in 2005,
 moved to Philadelphia where I get depressed. And in just, I don't have family there. There's
 something about the town. They don't seem to like me very much. But the main thing was being in the
 culture world at the time. There was a girl that I was dating. I remember, you know, she didn't seem
 to really approve what I did. And a lot of people didn't really seem to. And meanwhile, like, I was
 defending people on the left all the time. And they'd be like, Oh, that's good. They were defending
 someone left, but they still would never forgive me for defending someone on the right. And I
 remember saying at one point, I'm like, listen, I'm like, I'm a true believer in this stuff. I'm
 willing to defend Nazis. I'm certainly willing to defend Republicans. And she actually said,
 I think Republicans might be worse. And that didn't, that really shouldn't go very well.
 And then I nearly gotten fist fights a couple times with people on the right,
 because they found out I defended people who cracked jokes about 9/11. Like this happened
 more than once. I'm not, you know, by the time I'm in my twenties, I'm not fist fighting again.
 But yeah, it was always like that. You see how hypocritical people can be. You can see how
 friends can turn on you if they don't like your politics. So I got an early preview of this,
 of what the culture we were heading into by being the president of fire, and it was exhausting.
 And that was one of the main things that led me to be, you know, suicidally depressed.
 At the Belmont Center, if you told me that that would be the beginning of a new and better life
 for me, I would have laughed if I could have, but I would, you know, I don't like, you can tell I'm
 okay if I'm still laughing, and I wasn't laughing at that point. So I got a doctor and I started
 doing cognitive behavioral therapy. I started having all these voices in my head that were
 catastrophizing and, you know, gave over generalization and fortune telling, you know, mind reading,
 all of these things that they teach you not to do. And what you do in CBT is essentially you have
 something makes you upset. And then you just write down what the thought was. And, you know,
 something minor could happen in your response was, you know, like, well, the date seemed to go very
 well. And that's because I'm broken and we'll die alone. And you're like, okay, okay, okay.
 What are the following, you know, that's catastrophizing, that's mind reading, that's fortune telling,
 that's all this stuff. And you have to do this several times a day forever. I actually need to
 brush up on it at the moment. And it slowly over time voices in my head that have been saying,
 horrible, you know, horrible internal talk. It just didn't sound as convincing anymore,
 which was a really kind of like subtle effect. Like it was just kind of like, oh, wait, I don't
 buy that I'm broken. You know, like that doesn't sound true. That doesn't sound like truth from
 God, like it used to. And nine months after I was planning to kill myself, I was probably happier
 than I'd been in the decade. And that was one of the things that, you know, that the CBT is what
 led me to notice this in my own work that it felt like administrators were kind of selling
 cognitive distortions, but students weren't buying yet. And then when I started noticing that they
 seemed to come in actually already believing in a lot of this stuff, that would be very dangerous.
 And that led to calling the American mind and all that stuff. But the thing that was rough about
 writing, canceling the American mind, I'd have mentioned this already a couple of times,
 I got really depressed this past year, because I was studying, you know, there's a friend in there
 that I talk about who killed himself after being canceled. I talked to him a week before he killed
 himself. And I hadn't actually, I hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident
 I thought it would be totally fine because he had an insensitive tweet in June of 2020 and, you know,
 got forced out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors.
 He actually got a severance package, but they knew he'd sue and win because he had before.
 And so I waited to check in on him because we were so overwhelmed with the request for
 helps. And he was saying people were coming to his house still. And then he shot himself the next
 week. And I definitely, and because everyone knows, I'm so public about my struggle to this stuff,
 everybody who fights this stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time. And this is a very
 hard psychologically taxing business to be in. And even admitting this right now, like,
 I think about all the vultures out there, they'll have fun with it. Just like the same way when
 my friend Mike Adams killed himself, there were people celebrating on Twitter that a man was dead
 because they didn't like his tweets. And but somehow that made them compassionate for some
 abstract other person. So I was getting a little depressed and anxious. And the thing that really
 helped me more than anything else was confessing to my staff that I, you know, books take a lot of
 energy. So I knew they didn't want to hear that not only was this taking a lot of the boss's time,
 this was making him depressed and anxious. But when I finally told my the leadership of my staff,
 you know, people that even though I try to maintain a lot of distance from, I love very,
 very much, it made such a difference, you know, because I could be open about that. And the other
 thing was have you heard this conference dialogue? Oh, yes. It's like an invite only thing. It's
 Orrin Hoffman runs it. It intentionally tries to get people over the political spectrum to come
 together and have off the record conversations about big issues. And it was nice to be in a room
 where liberal, conservative, none of the above were all like, Oh, thank God, someone's taken on
 cancel culture. And where it felt like, it felt like maybe this won't be the disaster for me and
 my family that I was that I was starting to be afraid of it would be that taking the stuff on
 might actually have a happy ending. Well, one thing I just stands out from that
 is the the pain of cancellation can be really intense. And that doesn't necessarily mean losing
 your job, but just even you can call it blame, you can call whatever name, but just some number of
 people on the internet. And that number can be small, kind of saying bad things to you. Yeah,
 that can be a pretty powerful force to the human psyche, which is but was very surprising. And then
 the flip side also of that, it really makes me sad how cruel people can be. Yeah, it's such a
 thinking that your cause is social justice, in many cases, can lead people to think I can be as
 cruel as I want in pursuit of this. When a lot of times it's, you know, just a way to sort of
 vent some aggression on a person that you think of only as an abstraction.
 I think it's important for people to realize that they're whatever, like,
 whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you want to put out there,
 like, there's real people that can get hurt. Like, you can really get people to one be the worst
 version of themselves or to possibly take their own life. And it's not as real. Yeah.
 Well, that's one of the things that we do in the book, to really kind of address people who still
 try to claim this isn't real, is we just quote, we quote the pope, we quote Obama, we quote James
 Carville, we quote Taylor Swift on cancel culture. Like, and Taylor Swift quote is essentially
 about like how behind all of this, there's, when it gets particularly nasty, there's this very clear,
 you know, kill yourself kind of undercurrent to it. And it's cruel. And the problem is that in an
 environment so wide open, there's always going to be someone who wants to be so transgressive and
 say the most hurtful, you know, terrible thing. But then you have to remember the misrepresentation,
 getting back to the old idioms, sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never,
 never hurt me, has been reimagined in campus debates in the most asinine way. People will
 literally say stuff like, but now we know where it's can hurt. And it's like, now we know where
 it's can hurt? Guys, you didn't have to come up with a special little thing that you teach
 children to make words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place. It wouldn't even make
 sense, the saying. It's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength when the
 bullies have noticed you're a little weird, maybe a little personal. And it helps. It really does
 help to be like, listen, okay, assholes are going to say asshole things. And I can't let them have
 that kind of power over me. Yeah. Yeah, it's still is a learning experience because it does it does
 hurt. But for the good people out there who actually, you know, just sometimes think that
 they're vented, you know, think about it. Remember that there were people on the other side of it.
 Yeah, for me, it hurts my kind of faith and humanity. I know it shouldn't, but it does sometimes.
 When I just see people being cruel to each other, it floats a cloud over my perspective of the
 world that I wish didn't have to be there. Yeah, that was always my sort of flippant,
 but the answer to that if mankind is basically good, or basically evil being like the biggest
 debate in philosophy and being like, well, the problem with the first is there's nothing basic
 about humanity. Yeah, what gives you hope about this whole thing, about this dark state that we're in
 as you describe, how can we get out? What gives you hope that we will get out? I think that people
 are sick of it. I think people are sick of not being able to be authentic. And that's really,
 you know, what censorship is. It's basically telling you don't be yourself. Don't actually
 be to say what you think. Don't show your personality. Don't dissent. Don't be weird. Don't be wrong.
 And that's not sustainable. I think that people have kind of had enough of it. But one thing I
 definitely want to say to your audience is it can't just be up to us, our yours, to try to fix this.
 And I think that, and this may sound like it's an unrelated problem, I think if there were
 highly respected, let's say extremely difficult ways to prove that you're extremely smart and
 hardworking that cost little or nothing, that actually can give the harvards and the
 yales of the world a run for their money, I think that might be the most positive thing we could do
 to deal with a lot of these problems and why. I think the fact that we have become a weird
 America with a great anti-elitist tradition has become weirdly elitist in the respect that we
 not only, again, are our leadership coming from these few fancy schools, we actually have like
 great admiration for them. We kind of look up to them. But I think we'd have a lot healthier of a
 society if people could prove their excellence in ways that are coming from completely different
 streams. And that are highly respected. I sometimes talk about, there should be a test that anyone
 who passes it gets like a BA in the humanities that is like a super BA, like something like
 someone not a GED, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something that like
 a hundred people can pass. Some other way of actually not going through these massive,
 bloated, expensive institutions that people can raise their hands and say, ""I'm smart and hard
 working."" I think that could be an incredibly healthy way. I think we need additional streams
 for creative people to be solving problems, whether that's on X or someplace else. I think
 that there's lots of things that technology could do to really help with this. I think some of the
 stuff that Sal Khan is working on at Khan Academy could really help. So I think there's a lot of
 ways, but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing things, not just expecting
 the old things that have, say, $40 billion in the bank that they're going to reform themselves.
 And here's my, I've been picking on Harvard a lot, but I'm going to pick on them a little bit more.
 And I talk a lot about class again. And there's a great book called Poison Ivy by Evan Mandry,
 which I recommend to everybody. It's outrageous. It sounds like me in a rant at Stanford,
 which was, and I think the stat is elite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they
 have from the bottom 50 or 60% depending on the school. And when you look at how much they actually
 like replicate class privilege, it's really distressing. So everybody should read Poison Ivy.
 And above all else, if you're weird, continue being weird.
 And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest in the most beautiful way people
 ever met. Greg, thank you for the really important work you do. This was,
 everybody watch Kid Cosmic. I appreciate the class, the whole area that you brought here today,
 man. This is an amazing conversation. Thank you for the work you do. Thank you. Thank you. And for
 me, for deeply cares about education, higher education. Thank you for holding the MITs and the
 Harvard's accountable for doing right by the people that walk their halls. So thank you so much for
 talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Greg Luciano. To support this
 podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
 words from Noam Chomsky. If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for
 views you don't like. Gables was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin.
 If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech
 precisely for views you despise. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

 Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't
 have any kind of inhibition and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure.
 Maybe the solution is an evolutionary approach.
 Imagine that you have something like Reddit, Facebook and something like Twitter, or they
 have in common their companies that in some sense own a protocol and the protocol has
 different components or monetization, user management for user display for rating and
 so on.
 Imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart and you will do it in some
 sense like communities and these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols
 and design new ones.
 For instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community.
 The monetization can be redefined.
 The way you reward individual users for what can be redefined if you let the communities
 evolve and you just control it to such a way that you are incentivizing the most sentient
 communities that produce the most interesting behaviors that allow you to interact in the
 most helpful ways.
 That gives you information that is relevant to you, it allows you to build teams, it allows
 you to bring the best of you into this thing."

 accountable to their followers than the other way around.
 The way that you can coordinate actions is to prevent the natural spread of information
 and enforce a downward spread of information and ideas, right?
 This is currently, I think, what's happening in the attempts to curb social media is the
 attempt to make sure that people don't develop ideas that compete naturally between groups,
 but to impose a shared narrative on people top-down, and that in some sense leads to
 the end of liberalism.
 So you are forced to commit to ideas that come top-down because they come top-down, not
 because they are the right ideas.
 And this was especially apparent in the pandemic, which led to a widespread failure of social
 systems to coordinate in the U.S., right?
 It was quite abysmal in which the expertise of systems were not integrated into the behavior
 of the whole.
 There were a lot of people that realized what was going on, starting from the secret services
 in December, and the individual people in the health care system in January and February.
 And the public administration and the press trying to downplay this because they had agreed
 on a narrative that saw this mostly as a cosmetic issue.
 So it was an issue of whether there was a new virus coming out of China, and people need
 to stop travel from China, was seen through the lens of whether this is a racist thing.
 So what does this look like in the present political narratives?
 For a lot of people, this is still the case, right now in New York Times reporter writes
 on her Twitter account that she's, one day, we will stop thinking about talking about
 the Laplique hypothesis and realize it's racist origins, but this day, sadly, is not today.
 This shows that she generally believes that the question of whether this was leaked due
 to insufficient regulation, and we didn't react to this in the right way because we did
 the wrong thing.
 So we killed people because they made the wrong decisions, is an irrelevant perspective
 to her.
 To her, it's relevant, how does this fit into my political narrative, into the current story
 that I currently tell in the news, and this is the reality that she is committed to.
 It's quite fascinating, right?"
